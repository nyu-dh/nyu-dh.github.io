# Style Guide

## Site Structure 
*i.e., "Where do I put stuff???"*

## Markdown
*e.g., "Headings?? Links?? How??"*

### Make a link within your prose

> Markdown links are made like this: `[my link text](my-link-url)`.  
> 
> If you are linking to a page ***outside*** digitalhumanities.nyu.edu on another site, add the full url (with `https` strongly preferred): `[my link text](https://example.com/my-external-page)`.
> 
> If you are linking to a page ***within*** the NYU DH site, you have 2 options:  
> - `[my link text](/about)` (with the starting slash) would create a link relative to the site root, so `https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/about`.
> - `[my link text](about)` (without the starting slash) would create a link relative ***to the page you're editing.*** So if you're editing a page, e.g., `https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/seed-grants`, that link would resolve to `https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/seed-grants/about`.

| NYU Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowships | graduate fellowships | `student` `summer` | Although we call them 'summer' a lot, the fellowships do not have summer in the name. The participants in them are "Graduate fellows." |
| NYU Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities | The DH Certificate | `DHSS` | Neither "Digital Humanities and Social Sciences" nor the acronym "DHSS" should ever appear. Students enrolled in this program can be called "Digital Humanities graduate students"; generally those not enrolled shouldn't  |
