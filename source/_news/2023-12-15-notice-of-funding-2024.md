_Application Deadline:_ _March 3, 2024_

NYU Center for the Humanities, NYU Libraries, and NYU Research and Instructional Technology invite applications for a fifth series of [Digital Humanities Seed Grants](/funding/seed-grants/).

These grants are intended to fund the initial development of new research projects that will analyze digital sources, apply algorithmic methods to humanities data, or create digital publications, exhibits, or websites. The goal of the program is to seed projects that may go on to receive greater funding from other sources or otherwise build NYU’s institutional capacity in Digital Humanities work.

For more information (and to apply), visit <a target="_none" href="https://nyuhumanities.org/opportunity/digital-humanities-seed-grants/">NYU Center for Humanities</a>.

For application questions, contact dh.help@nyu.edu. You can also browse [past successful projects](/projects/seed-grants/) on our own website to get inspired.

We highly encourage you to attend one of our DH Seed Grant grant workshops (dates and registration links below).

NYU Center for the Humanities, NYU Libraries, and NYU Research and Instructional Technology invite applications for 2024 [Digital Humanities Graduate Student Fellowships](/funding/grad-fellowships/).

Project work will take place during Summer 2024, and participants will report on work completed at a Fall 2024 event.
