## Digital Humanities Seed Grants (Faculty)

_Deadline:_ _March 3, 2023_

NYU Center for the Humanities, NYU Libraries, and NYU Research and Instructional Technology invite applications for a fifth series of Digital Humanities Seed Grants. These grants are intended to fund the initial development of new research projects that will analyze digital sources, apply algorithmic methods to humanities data, or create digital publications, exhibits, or websites. The goal of the program is to seed projects that may go on to receive greater funding from other sources or otherwise build NYU’s institutional capacity in Digital Humanities work.
