## Digital Humanities Seed Grants (Faculty)

_Deadline:_ ~~March 5, 2023~~ _March 12, 2023_

The Center for the Humanities, in partnership with the NYU Libraries and NYU Research Technology invites applications for a third series of Digital Humanities Seed Grants. These grants are intended to fund the initial development of new research projects that will analyze digital sources, apply algorithmic methods to humanities data, or create digital publications, exhibits, or websites. The goal of the program is to seed projects that may go on to receive greater funding from other sources or otherwise build NYU’s institutional capacity in Digital Humanities work.

## Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowships (Graduate Students)

The Center for the Humanities, in partnership with the NYU Libraries and NYU Research Technology, invites applications for 2023 Digital Humanities Graduate Student Summer Fellowships. Students apply with their own proposed project, which might involve–for example–engaging with digital humanities methods as the basis for a dissertation chapter or article, or building a digital public humanities project or exhibit. Project work will take place during Summer 2023, and participants will report on work completed at a Fall 2023 event.
