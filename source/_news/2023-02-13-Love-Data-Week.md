## Love Wikidata: A workshop to learn the possibilities

NYU Wikimedians, which include Libraries staff and faculty, are hosting an event for Love Data Week. The goal is to help scholars understand more about the ways they can use Wikidata to improve information flow on the web.

Did you know you can use Wikidata both to find and create data? Through the topic of climate change, this workshop will introduce Wikidata and the SPARQL query language through hands-on examples and activities. Participants will leave with tools to contribute to linked open data initiatives and to query and visualize openly available data. Founded in 2012, Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base of structured data. It supports other Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons) and is used as a data source for commercial products like Googleâ€™s Knowledge Graph. It also expands access across languages!
