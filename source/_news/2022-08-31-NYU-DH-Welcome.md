Dear NYU DH list,

With a new semester starting this week, we wanted to send a welcome to everyone on the [NYU DH list](mailto:nyudh@nyu.edu). We will continue to post to the list about opportunities and resources and we hope you will share your projects with the community!  Simply email [nyudh@nyu.edu](mailto:nyudh@nyu.edu) with your posting. We also encourage faculty to post course descriptions and any public DH syllabuses.

**NYU DH list: Who? What? How often?**
NYU DH list is for anyone and everyone at NYU interested in digital humanities, whether as part of their studies or as a side interest. Please invite your friends, students, and colleagues! New students may not know about the list and we want you to share. Sign up at (https://groups.google.com/a/nyu.edu/d/forum/nyudh-group).
Posting will remain light, but if you want to change your list settings or leave the group, learn more at [NYU IT's page about groups](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-collaboration/email-and-communication/nyu-groups.html).

**NYU DH Support: DSS and Data Services here to help!**
NYU Libraries wants to support your work in and out of the classroom. We encourage you to [request an appointment](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2srvrbNYpL05GW9) with Digital Scholarship Services in the Library to get one-one-one help with project planning, choosing platforms, NYU resources, digital publishing, and more!  Data Services provide the most regular offering of technical skill-building workshopsâ€“ check for the full lineup on the [Data Services class calendar](https://guides.nyu.edu/DS_class_calendar) later this week. Come as often as you need. Likewise, feel free to email [dh.help@nyu.edu](mailto:dh.help@nyu.edu) with any questions.

If a group setting is more your speed, please come to our annual Libraries' Welcome Week workshops: 
Introduction to Data Services Wednesday, 9/7, 2PM
Introduction to Digital Scholarship Services Thursday, 9/8, 1pm. 

**NYU DH Website: SO much information!**
The DSS team has been working on a new [NYU DH website](digitalhumanities.nyu.edu) which showcases [faculty and student projects](https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/projects/) and offers ways to get involved and information about funding.

And stay tuned for details about the **2022 Digital Humanities Showcase** coming up October 6, 3:30pm, on Zoom. It's a great opportunity to see DH work of faculty and graduate students happening across NYU.

Can't wait for the DH to come,

Cheers,

Your Digital Scholarship Services team

Zach, Jojo, Marii, and Jo
