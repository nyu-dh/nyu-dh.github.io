---

Earlier this month, Digital Scholarship Student Specialist Jo Suk led a workshop called How to Build a Hypertext Garden Workshop at Bobst Library. First run in the spring semester, the workshop brought together faculty and graduate students across the arts and humanities to explore hypertext and nonlinear storytelling. In the exercise portion, attendees got hands-on with Twine, an open-source interactive storytelling tool built by Chris Klimas and maintained by a community of independent artists, writers, and game developers.

Outside of Digital Scholarship Services, Suk is a MPS candidate at the Interactive Telecommunications Program under Tisch School of Arts.
