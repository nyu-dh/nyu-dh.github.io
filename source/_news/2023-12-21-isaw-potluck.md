  NYU DH’s first “potluck abroad” at ISAW.
---

This month, instead of gathering in our usual Room 743 for the Digital Humanities Potluck, a group of us went uptown to visit the [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](https://isaw.nyu.edu/) (ISAW) Library. We went at the invitation of Patrick Burns, Associate Research Scholar of Digital Projects at the ISAW Library and a Potluck regular. Upon our arrival, Burns gave us an introduction to ISAW and a quick tour of the facilities, which included their 3-floor library and a grand spiral staircase.

After the tour, we attended the final project presentations of students Manolis Mavrotis, Madeleine Cahn, Vikentiy Parshuto, and Julie Han in the Introduction to Digital Humanities for the Ancient World Seminar. Topics included ancient theaters, isopsephy, excavation visualizations, and village-county dynamics. The presentations were followed by light discussion and afternoon tea in the Oak Library.
