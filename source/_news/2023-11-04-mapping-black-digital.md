Two NYU DH community projects added to Mapping the Black Digital and Public Humanities database!

[Mapping the Black Digital and Public Humanities](https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/mappingbdph/) is a project based at James Madison University, established in 2022 by Iliana Cosme-Brooks, graduate student at the School of Writing, Rhetoric & Technical Communication, Mollie Godfrey, Associate Professor of English & African, African American, and Diaspora Studies, Kevin Hegg, Head of Digital Projects, JMU Libraries’ Digital Scholarship and Distinctive Collections, and Seán McCarthy Associate Professor of Writing, Rhetoric and Technical Communication. As they note on [their About page](https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/mappingbdph/about/), the group invited students and collaborators on a "data-gathering, mapping, and visualization adventure" with the goal "to make projects such as Celebrating Simms and many, many others more visible and better able to connect with, learn from, and support one another." 

We are thrilled to have two NYU DH projects added to their map.

NYU Libraries' Special Collections [Black Solidarity Day](https://specialcollections.hosting.nyu.edu/exhibitions/black-solidarity-day/) was envisioned by Jasmine Sykes-Kunk after many of the NYU Libraries staff participated in the #StrikeforBlackLIves #ShutdownAcademia in June 2020. To connect NYU's Black Solidarity Day collection materials within NYU Special Collections, the project aimed to build a space for community connection and greater awareness of this annual day of protest created in 1969 by Dr. Carlos Russell.

[Amplifying the Soul of Reason](https://specialcollections.hosting.nyu.edu/projects/soul-of-reason/) was a cross-departmental initiative at NYU led by Janet Bunde and Alexandra Provo. Aiming to transform a historically and culturally rich radio program on Black and Latino culture into a collaboratively curated collection as data, the project invited community members to correct auto-generated transcripts of digital audio files of the radio program and then contributed to Wikidata and Wikipedia through an [edit-a-thon on June 19, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/AfroCROWD/NYU_Soul_of_Reason).
