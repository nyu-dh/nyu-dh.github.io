In the first DH Potluck of the Spring 2024 semester, NYU DH joins up with Data Services for the first ever Digital Humanities Data Services Snackoff! Held on February 13, 11am-1pm, in Bobst 743, the event is part of NYU's celebration of the [International Love Data Week](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/3799).

What does a DH DS Snackoff mean? As with NYU DH's monthly DH Potlucks, we take the term to mean a bring-what-you-will to share, whether it's a snack or a project! By joining up with [Data Services](https://guides.nyu.edu/dataservices/), we're hoping to inspire people to compare and contrast snacks both culinary and digital!

- Social Explorer makes "[Data Snacks](https://www.socialexplorer.com/teach-and-learn/data-snacks?category=)" which are quick data stories generated from their platform.
- You can use snacks to create visualizations like the [Data Cuisine](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/what-do-data-visualizations-look-like-as-food) project (an oldie, but a tasty looking one)
- Recipes can be used as data like the CondeNast [FoodGraph](https://medium.com/@condenastitaly/when-food-meets-ai-the-smart-recipe-project-eea259f53ed2) project
- Even Google has put together a fun food datavis: [Rhythm of Food](https://rhythm-of-food.net/).
