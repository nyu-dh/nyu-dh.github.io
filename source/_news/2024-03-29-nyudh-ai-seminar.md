This month, NYU Digital Humanities hosted [NYU Digital Theory Lab](https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/projects/digital-theory-lab/) for an online seminar about AI on March 13, 2024. The event featured work by faculty and student members of the NYU Digital Theory Lab, who shared their research and perspectives on the current state of the field.

- Artificial Intelligence and Digital Zombies - David Bering-Porter, The New School
- Transformers Are Large Literary Machines - Leif Weatherby, NYU German
- Between Nonsense and Logic: Multimodal Systems and Other Possibilities - Claire Song, NYU Comparative Literature
- Abstraction and Genre in Deep Neural Networks - Ryan Healey, NYU English

Led by Leif Weatherby and formerly Zach Coble, Digital Theory Lab has been interrogating large language models and machine learning since its inception as part of the [Benett-Polonsky Humanities Labs](https://hlabs.nyuhumanities.org/about/) in 2018. Since then, its mission has kept pace with the release of generative AI platforms like ChatGPT4 and Midjourney including last Septemberâ€™s day-long seminar [Re-Interpretation: Hermeneutics in the Age of AI](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/english/Events/fall-2023/re-interpretation--hermeneutics-in-the-age-of-ai.html).
