The Data Services division of NYU Libraries and IT, the Graduate School of Arts & Science Master’s College, and the Arts & Sciences Office of Ed Tech is excited to launch a new training opportunity for graduate students! The [Foundations of Research Computing (FORC) Camp](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/forc-camp/home) is a pilot three day data skills immersion program that will be offered August 23-25, 2023. FORC will target A&S Master’s College students but be open to any NYU graduate student as capacity permits (limit is 40 students per track). There is something for everyone, from creating visualizations that require no coding skills to data harvesting and statistical analysis.

Getting a grounding in foundational data skills early in researchers’ careers is critical, because training in digital methods can bring to light new connections and offer new ways of seeing familiar subjects. This need is particularly pressing for Master’s students, who have a shorter time to degree and thus an accelerated research schedule. 

FORC will allow students to choose one of three tracks: 

[Telling Stories with Data (Noncoding)](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/forc-camp/home#h.b6mil9dg85ip)

[Intro to Coding: Practical Python for Research Applications](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/forc-camp/home#h.dmd7uxth9lpc)

[Advancing Your Quantitative Analysis Skills Using R](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/forc-camp/home#h.5g0o797kjad1)

Each day’s schedule will include two to four hours of interactive instruction followed by a 90 minute office hours/tea time that offers opportunities for one on one consults, meeting with subject area librarians, and building connections within the cohort. An optional 90 minutes of homework will allow participants to apply digital skills to their own research for feedback from FORC instructors.

Participants who complete all 15 hours of the FORC curriculum will receive a letter of completion for their portfolio detailing the skills covered in their track.

If you are a faculty member with potential student participants in mind for this excellent training opportunity, please forward this information to them! Interested students should visit the FORC site for details and registration. Send inquiries to [fas-edtech-group@nyu.edu](mailto:fas-edtech-group@nyu.edu).
