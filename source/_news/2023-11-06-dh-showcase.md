  A recap of the 2023 Digital Humanities Showcase and the people and projects featured.
--- 

On October 5th, NYU [Division of Libraries](https://library.nyu.edu/), [Research and Instructional Technology](https://www.nyu.edu/research/navigating-research-technology.html), and the [Center for Humanities]() hosted the 2023 Digital Humanities Showcase to resounding applause.

Presenters spoke on histories of art, archives, and anti-imperialism. They used natural language processing (NLP) to glean patterns in chemistry papers, enthographies, and autobiographies at scale. They mapped food insecurity, built a VR museum, an AR garden, a digital Quechua library, and so much more.
