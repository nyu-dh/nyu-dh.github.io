Jubilee Marshall’s Graduate Fellow project, Black Burials in Philadelphia: A Walking Tour, enriches the existing narrative of white and Black churches, graveyards, and other historic sites in Philadelphia. The digital walking tour takes visitors through around a dozen stops, accompanied by a detailed portrait of the milieu surrounding each location. 

“This project gave me a really valuable opportunity to learn technical skills in order to create a digital public history project,” Marshall reflects. “I was able to parlay these foundational skills into my graduate thesis and my professional career.” Some of the skills and resources Marshall credits in her project are NYU web hosting, Digital Scholarship Services, and NYU accessibility guides. 

Since the Graduate Fellowship, Marshall has applied her digital knowledge to a number of projects. Marshall’s aforementioned graduate thesis took shape as a website exploring the internet fandom around Gone with the Wind and how it has shaped popular memory of slavery and the Civil War. She also presented on “Scrollytelling as a Method for Digital Scholarship” at the National Council on Public History’s annual conference this past April. 

Marshall’s growing body of digital projects have gained acclaim at NYU and beyond. Her graduate thesis alone earned the GSAS Master's Award for Academic Achievement, the Department of History Master’s Award for Academic Achievement, and third place in the Threesis Academic Challenge.
