  2022 Graduate Fellow Jubilee Marshall, M.A., Black Burials in Philadelphia: A Walking Tour
---

For her Graduate Fellowship project, 2022 Fellow Jubilee Marshall built on research she had done in her undergraduate thesis, published in 2020 in â€œPennsylvania History", to create a mobile-friendly, browser-based digital walking tour of Old City Philadelphia that features white and Black churches and graveyards. 

When asked what she was most proud of, Marshall remarked, "This project gave me a really valuable opportunity to learn technical skills in order to create a digital public history project. I was able to parlay these foundational skills into my graduate thesis and my professional career. The digital projects that I have worked on since have gained some recognition both at NYU (Threesis Academic Challenge Third Place, Department of History Master's Award for Academic Achievement, and GSAS Master's Award for Academic Achievement (I am currently a finalist)) and beyond." In April she presented on digital publication at the National Council on Public History's Digital Public History Lab at their annual conference.

Marshall commented, "although this specific project is complete, my experience as a DH grad fellow directly informed my graduate thesis and the work I am doing now. I used NYU web hosting and the digital knowledge I developed through my fellowship to create a website exploring the impact of Gone with the Wind (and its digital fandom) on popular conceptions of slavery and the Civil War (https://jubilee.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/). 

Taking advantage of NYU web hosting and digital scholarship services, as well as NYU's accessibility guides, Marshall built her skills through her Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship.
