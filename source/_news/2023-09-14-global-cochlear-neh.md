NYU Faculty [Mara Mills](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/mara-mills) (Media, Culture, and Communication) and [Michelle Friedner](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/michele-friedner) of the University of Chicago have been awarded a prestigious Dangers and Opportunities of Technology Grant from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities. The team, which includes authors who themselves use cochlear implants, won $149,815 outright.

In their project "The Global Cochlear Implant: Provincializing ‘Brain Implants’ Through Disability Technoculture," Mills and Friedner will conduct a humanistic comparative study of cochlear implant technology as an early form of neural-computer interface.
