  A recap of the fall Digital Humanities Potlucks.
---
Once a month, the NYU Digital Humanities community gathers together at Bobst Library to share snacks and projects in progress. These meetings have brought students, staff, and faculty together from across disciplines and schools to share their work.

This fall, we have had two students give informal presentations on upcoming works for feedback from other potluck guests. On October 10, [Ayami Hatanaka](https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/news/2023-06-23-fellow-spotlight-ACS-in-SoHo/), who gave a preview of her presentation “Being Made Visible: Surveillance and Mapping Family Policing Institutions in New York City” ahead of the ASA Conference.

The following month, on November 3, [Gavin Beinart-Smollan](https://digitalhumanities.nyu.edu/projects/jewish-cookbooks/) gave a presentation on building a genealogy database using data from the National Desertion Bureau, which tracked down men who had abandoned their families at the turn of the twentieth century. Thank you to Ayami and Gavin for sharing your works with the DH community!

The [next potluck](https://nyu.libcal.com/event/11427535) will be the first of its kind, taking place uptown at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) Library. Potluck attendees will take a tour of ISAW and are then invited to attend presentations of ISAW's Intro to Digital Humanities seminar. Potluck participants are invited to stay for ISAW community tea at 3:30 pm. We hope to see you there!
