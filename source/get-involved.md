There are many ways to get involved with DH at NYU. The easiest ways are to join the [email list](https://groups.google.com/a/nyu.edu/g/nyudh-group?pli=1) (n.b. you will need to click the link for "joining the group") or the [Slack channel](https://forms.gle/kzxyJLetPz4pGGY78). The DH at NYU email list is a great way to receive periodic updates on events, opportunities, and funding available to the NYU community.

All graduate students interested in digital humanities can enroll in [individual courses](/curriculum/courses/) in the [Advanced Certificate program in Digital Humanities](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/dh.html). Talk to your advisor or email [dh.help@nyu](mailto:dh.help@nyu) if you are interested in formally enrolling in the certificate program.

Graduate students are also encouraged to apply for the [Digital Humanities Summer Fellowship program](/funding/grad-fellowships/). The DH Fellows program supports selected NYU graduate students as they develop innovative digital humanities projects. Successful applicants receive mentoring, a $5,000 stipend, and participate in a cohort to develop their skills and sharpen their ideas.

Faculty interested in digital humanities are encouraged to apply for the [Digital Humanities Seed Grants](/funding/seed-grants/). The Seed Grants program identifies and funds faculty-led projects that creatively bridge humanistic scholarship with new forms of computation, digital publishing, and digitization.

Additionally, DH at NYU hosts many events throughout the year, from the annual showcase event in the fall to regular, informal DH potluck meetings. Read more about [past events](/news/events/) and subscribe to the [email list](https://groups.google.com/a/nyu.edu/g/nyudh-group?pli=1) for the latest information on the next event.

There are many services available across NYU to support and advance you project. Visit the [Resources page](/resources/) for more information.
