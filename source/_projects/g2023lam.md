abstract: 'This project uses text analysis to examine evidence collected for the 1936
  Mui Tsai Investigation. The interviews and memorandum that comprise this material
  was part of the British Empire’s attempt to address a longstanding debate concerning
  the mui tsai institution in British Hong Kong and Malaya. The Mui Tsai institution
  placed young girls in what Chinese families viewed as adoption and household duties
  and what European activists viewed as trafficking and slavery. International uproar
  and debate stemmed from this disagreement of definitions and appropriate regulatory
  measures. In this project, I use methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis
  to conduct text analysis with R on a random selection of this material to shed light
  on the investigation process. This analysis uncovers insights such as biases in
  interview questioning and how witnesses’ overall sentiments towards the mui tsai
  institution were influenced by their geo-cultural origins and experiences. Together,
  these findings contribute to our understanding of the British Empire during a period
  of imperial decline: how it navigated intercultural tension and international standard-setting,
  and how the process of colonial knowledge construction shifted accordingly. Further,
  the findings of this project hold great potential for public humanities engagement.
  Throughout the processes of data creation and text wrangling, this project creates
  digital social knowledge that can be used to foster greater learning and exploration
  of the intercultural differences that convolute contemporary debates of trafficking,
  slavery and their regulation. While this project creates its own interpretations,
  it also provides a foundation that invites further work.'
