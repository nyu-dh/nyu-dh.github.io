abstract: 'This proposed project involves two components: developing digital humanities
  tools and creating digitally enhanced public history. It revolves around a collection
  of interviews and memoranda from the British imperial government’s 1936 investigation
  of the Mui Tsai controversy in colonial Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. The
  Mui Tsai institution placed young girls in what elite Chinese families viewed as
  adoption and household duties and what European activists viewed as trafficking
  and slavery. This disagreement of definitions and appropriate regulatory measures
  caused international uproar. My project will contribute to our understanding of
  how the British Empire navigated intercultural tension and international standard-setting
  during a period of imperial decline. It will also provide insight on the intercultural
  differences that convolute contemporary debates of trafficking, slavery and their
  regulation. The testimonies provide a rare glimpse into the lived experiences at
  the heart of a convoluted political debate. Existing scholarship has largely overlooked
  both the everyday lives of Mui Tsai and this archive. The two-volume, print-only
  collection lacks thematic organization and offers limited accessibility. However,
  its English-language printed format, length and organization make it ideal for digital
  analysis. In the digital methodology component of my project, I will generate a
  dataset for text analysis in R Studio to explore frequencies and correlations to
  uncover key themes in the testimonies. This text analysis will inform the project’s
  public-facing component – an online resource that presents thematic selections of
  testimonies to foster conversation and learning about this history and the continued
  present-day significance of its themes.'
