title: Demystifying the Digitization of Texts
subtitle: New Textual Analysis for the Medieval History of Islamic Mysticism

abstract: 'The digitization of Latin-script languages has fundamentally changed the
  scope of scholarship in the humanities, but only recently have scholars undertaken
  similar projects for Arabic-script texts. The Open Islamicate Texts Initiative (OpenITI)
  represents the most significant effort to date in producing a corpus of machine
  actionable texts written in Arabic, currently containing over 10,000 works. Despite
  the size of this project, some bodies of literature are significantly unrepresented,
  chief among them are works on Sufism, usually understood as Islamic mysticism. In
  fact, only 153 of the 10,393 entries in OpenITI are Sufi works, despite Sufism’s
  immense popularity over the last millennium. Given this gap in the extant textual
  corpora, this project will produce the first machine actionable corpus of medieval
  Sufi works, comprised of twenty-four key texts annotated according to the field
  standard mARkdown “tagging” schema. Furthermore, this project will put together
  a suite of Python-based tools to allow for various analyses. These tools will focus
  on four areas: extracting names of individuals for network analysis to better understand
  Sufi social history; examining Qur’ānic references to illuminate how Sufis interpreted
  and understood the word of God; using algorithms to elucidate the complex and subtle
  ways in which authors drew from one another; and exploring the changing semantics
  of key terms and foundational concepts in Sufi thought across time. This project
  will not only shed new light on medieval Sufi history but also contribute to efforts
  already underway to digitize Islamic texts by introducing a previously neglected
  body of literature.'
