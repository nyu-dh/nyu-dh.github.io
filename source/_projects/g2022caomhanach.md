abstract: By the late twentieth century, conservation scientists declared that time
  was “running out” for Madagascar as plant species were “disappearing 500 times faster
  than normal.” Plants deemed immortal in Malagasy culture, such as the famous Baobab
  Tree have, for the past few decades, teetered on the edge of extinction. Yet the
  contingencies of climate change have shifted conservation priorities so dramatically
  that, in recent years, botanical evolutionary concepts have been applied unequally
  in light of seemingly more pressing human-centric concerns. Without plants, though,
  humans will go extinct. Focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth century plant collections
  at the Missouri Botanical Garden and New York Botanical Garden, this project will
  (1) create a database of herbarium specimens collected in Madagascar, (2) use ArcGis
  to map the locations of these specimens, and (3) map plantations of luxury high-priced
  botanicals that have driven human-centric agriculture (vanilla, clove, and coffee).
  By incorporating Malagasy worldviews about the place of plants in their broader
  environment into this digital project, I question how ecological and evolutionary
  knowledge has been created and conveyed to both local and global conservation groups
  on an island rife with deforestation, political and social conflict—all contributing
  to its status as one of the top ten nations most vulnerable to climate change. Intersecting
  conservation law, critical archival studies, and the history of science, this project
  uses a variety of scientific specimens and data alongside archival material to question
  the colonial legacies of conservation science over Malagasy knowledge.
