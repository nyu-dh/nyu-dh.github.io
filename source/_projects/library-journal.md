abstract: With interdisciplinary humanistic inquiry at the heart of paired library
  and information science and subject studies, MLIS and MA dual degree programs are
  uniquely positioned to positively impact critical scholarship and discourse at the
  intersections of cultural production and information exchange. And as publication
  is fundamental to the research lifecycle, creating a space for dialogic engagement
  is key. This project aims to solicit, collect, and publish the works of MLIS-MA
  dual degree graduate students using the NYU Manifold platform by building an infrastructure
  for a sustainable peer-review editing process and a design that allows for multi-modal
  format submissions. Based on the Division of Librariesâ€™ Dual Degree Mentorship Program,
  which provides mentorship, publishing and career-building opportunities for students
  pursuing the MSLIS at Long Island University's Palmer School of Library and Information
  Science and subject master degrees across interdisciplinary programs at NYU, this
  journal will be a first for NYU Manifold, allowing for the initiation of likeminded
  open-access projects by scholars and content creators across NYU communities. This
  project creates a model for the journal structure within Manifold while simultaneously
  providing a site for scholarly conversation that bridges the information landscape
  and the humanities.
