abstract: 'This research project stems from provocations by abolitionist organizers
  in New York City, with questions such as, “Why are there no ACS offices in SoHo?”
  For the summer of 2022, I aim to create an interactive, digital map that layers
  three key data sets for visualization: 1) the number of child welfare investigations
  that take place in New York City by neighborhood, 2) the location of Administration
  for Children’s Services (ACS) offices, and 3) the locations of the top New York
  City schools that make reports to the Office of Children and Family Services. The
  overarching research question for this digital mapping project is: what does understanding
  space relationally reveal about surveillance tools and practices in family policing?
  Asking such a question is rooted in the methodologies of Black Feminist Geographies.
  Following Simone Browne’s work regarding surveillance technologies, I’d like to
  understand the spatial relationship between schools, child welfare offices, and
  the space of the home through the home visits caseworkers conduct. My intention
  is this project will inform aspects of my dissertation. As a scholar engaged with
  communities organizing to make changes in how the state interacts with families,
  especially poor Black and Brown families, my intention is not only for this digital
  map to serve an intellectual purpose of answering research questions, but for this
  map to hopefully lead to change in how family policing is understood in New York
  City.'
