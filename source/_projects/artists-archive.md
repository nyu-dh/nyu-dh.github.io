abstract: The Artist Archives Initiative promotes research and disseminates knowledge
  about the display and care of contemporary art. The initiative responds to a growing
  need for art world professionals and academic researchers to work with artists in
  building information resources to aid future exhibition and re-activation of their
  work. The Initiative contains the David Wojnarowicz Knowledge Base and the Joan
  Jonas Knowledge Base, which are resources intended to aid curators, conservators,
  and others who are researching the work these artists, and to assist in future exhibition
  and conservation of the artists' works.
