abstract: NewYorkScapes is a research community exploring the application of digital
  concepts, tools, and resources to the study of the history of urban cultures and
  landscapes. Founded in 2013, the initiative comprises a number of activities and
  faculty workshop dedicated to integrating teaching built around long-term digital
  projects into the larger collective research community. NewYorkScapes also seeks
  to make discoverable historic data related to the city of New York in both its non-digital
  and digital forms, and to collaboratively build that data for research purposes
  where it is not yet existent.
