abstract: The City Record Project hosts the New York City Record from its first volume
  in 1873 through 1949. The City Record contains data on every aspect of the cityâ€™s
  politics, society, economy, real estate and infrastructure development, employment,
  and expenditures and aids scholars studying the city because of the depth and breadth
  of the data it contains, offering digitized resources unmatched by any other city.
  Supported by a NEH Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant, the digitized
  and searchable PDF documents openly accessible to the public.
