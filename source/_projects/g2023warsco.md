title: Making an Accessible Catalog for the CLACS Quechua Library
category: Grad Fellowship Project

cohort_year: '2023'
abstract: I began creating a Quechua library through NYU’s Center for Latin American
  and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) this semester. This library includes Quechua language
  learning books, story books, Andean history books, movies, audio files, and archival
  materials that have been a part of CLACS’s collection for many years. However, these
  materials are largely unknown to the community, and aren’t easily accessible or
  even browsable. Founded in critical and Indigenous library theory, the library is
  aimed at providing students and community members in NYU, NYC, and beyond with intentional,
  mindful, and relevant materials for their interests. This specific portion of the
  project I am seeking funding for is the transition of these cataloged materials
  into an ILS (integrated Library System) and to create a website to provide broader
  access to these materials. This grant will support this next step, integration.
  This would include creating a website that makes the library’s materials clearly
  and easily accessible and browsable. The website will serve as an integrated library
  system and catalog that includes the materials, relevant tags, recommendations,
  and easier search functionalities than its current state. This work will feed directly
  into the next steps of digitizing and distribution of the library, which will be
  completed later in my graduate studies.
