title: Making an Accessible Catalog for the CLACS Quechua Library

cohort_year: '2023'
abstract: 'I began creating a Quechua library through NYU’s Center for Latin American
  and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) in Spring 2023. This library includes Quechua language
  learning books, story books, Andean history books, movies, audio files, and archival
  materials that have been a part of CLACS’s collection for many years. However, these
  materials are largely unknown to the community, and aren’t easily accessible. This
  summer, using a database of the materials and CollectionBuilder: an open source,
  Jekyll-based framework for creating digital collections, I created a Runakunaq Bibliotecanku
  (The People''s Library) for easier browsing and searching through the collection.
  The website is up, with many improvements on the way (including trilingual browsing
  and search, more local metadata, and more visualizations of the collection). At
  this time, patrons can browse, search, and request scans of any of the print materials
  we have at the CLACS library.'
