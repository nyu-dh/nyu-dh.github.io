abstract: The Knoxo Freedom Schools Oral History Archive is the digital home of an
  ongoing collection of oral history interviews about the Freedom Schools in Knoxo,
  Mississippi. In 2023, the Mississippi Heritage Trust named the Freedom Schools one
  of the top 10 most endangered historical sites in the state. Though dilapidated
  and located in a town of fewer than 13,000 people, the Freedom Schools are an essential
  part of the history of Black resistance during the Civil Rights Era. The Archive
  is designed to preserve and make the history of Knoxo available to everyone by acting
  as a repository for oral history interviews with people who attended the Freedom
  Schools. The site also hosts transcripts of the interviews, scans of photographs
  and archival documents, a map of the area, and a 3D spatial scan of the site as
  it exists today.
