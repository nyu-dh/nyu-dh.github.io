abstract: An enormous amount of disability theoretical and activist work takes place
  on social media (Wong 2022). For many disabled and chronically ill people, physical
  spaces and normative timetables are inaccessible, making online community vitally
  important (Rogers 2023). Yet digital platforms are not universally accessible, and
  they are often highly ephemeral. The NYU Center for Disability Studies has been
  preserving disability social media conversations, actions, informational resources,
  and art related to the pandemic, as well as records of digital public meetings and
  other online activities. Our goal has been to chronicle not only vulnerabilities,
  but creative initiatives for survival, in these new conditions structured by old
  inequalities. A seed grant will enable us to a) broaden the scope of the disability
  media we have collected; b) formulate best practices for archiving websites, posts
  and threads in an accessible manner; and c) draft and receive feedback on a larger
  digital preservation grant.
