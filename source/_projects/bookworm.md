abstract: 'Bookworm makes it easy to interactively explore massive collections of
  texts as data. If you have a huge collection of texts, it provides a way to interpret
  them, make them explorable, and unlock them to a wide variety of uses even if you
  can''t share them freely for copyright or other reasons. '
