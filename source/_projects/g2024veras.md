abstract: Understanding the relationship between legal, fiscal, and political pressures
  and jail conditions is especially pressing given the magnitude of exposure to jail
  in the US, the conditions within these spaces, the politically unique position of
  US jail administrators, and the racism endemic to the criminal justice system. Currently,
  there exists no centralized resource presenting information on jail conditions over
  time, or on shifts in legal, fiscal, and political processes pertinent to jail operations.
  The Ohio Jails Repository will serve as a digital resource for users to navigate
  through various timelines of events and actors in the history of the Cleveland and
  Columbus area jails since the 1980s through the 2020 pandemic, and to learn about
  how and why jail conditions change over time more broadly. This proposed data visualization
  resource can facilitate insight into how the complex network of actors, finances,
  and governmental institutions have shaped outcomes for generations of individuals
  moving through county jails. The primary goals of this project are to preserve a
  unique collection of information, make this material accessible to the public, and
  provide a model for other studies of local jails. The Ohio Jails Repository will
  also be a digital resource that will facilitate civic engagement, and provide analytic
  resources for those looking to advocate for individuals involved in the carceral
  system.
