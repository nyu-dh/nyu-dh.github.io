abstract: The Purple Perspective is a summer project that aims to build a digital
  feminist archive of Black women and gender expansive people’s print and material
  artifacts that utilize or feature the color purple, and illustrate the significance
  of purple to these cultures through qualitative-data visualization. This work is
  born out of my Master’s research on purple and Black women’s rhetorics, where I
  argue novelist and scholar Alice Walker’s definition of ‘womanist’–”Womanist is
  to feminist as purple is to lavender” (Walker, xvi)–has not only offset the radical
  concept and practice of Womanism, but arguably has set in motion a ‘Womanist aesthetic’(D.
  Bhagyathara) in the prominence of purple across Black women’s media broadly defined.
  From the dust jackets of books on Black women’s studies and marketing for Black
  dolls, to website interfaces, scholarly databases and digital fliers for symposia
  on Black femmes’ lives, the physical and digital artifacts have become staggering
  and far reaching within the contemporary moment. There has yet to be a dedicated
  archive to such artifacts; this, in addition to the phenomenon rarely being talked
  about, if at all. The Purple Perspective aspires to reformulate the digital feminist
  archive to also function as a visualization tool to best illustrate the depth and
  scope of the significance of purple in Black women and gender expansive people’s
  lives.
