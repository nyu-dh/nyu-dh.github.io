abstract: Digital technologies challenge the categories we use to interpret the world
  and understand ourselves. The Lab proceeds from the premise that understanding contemporary
  digital cultures and concepts requires a theoretical foundation. It provides a platform
  to engage in dialogue with contemporary researchers and collaborative experimentation
  with computational systems in ways that exceed traditional fields of study. Lab
  members combine their diverse research expertise in humanities, arts, and engineering
  to investigate the historically specific issues that digital technologies raise,
  differentiating promotional hype from emerging frameworks of living, thinking, and
  being.
