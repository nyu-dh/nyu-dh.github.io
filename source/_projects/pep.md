title: Developing a Publications Page for NYU’s Prison Education Program (PEP) Website
category: DH Seed Grant Recipient

- exhibition
cohort_year: '2020'
abstract: This project will establish a website that showcases the finest writing
  generated by students enrolled in NYU’s Prison Education Project. Unlike many websites
  that publish diaristic writing from the incarcerated, this website focuses on displaying
  students’ abilities as critical and creative thinkers fully capable of engaging
  in rigorous academic and scholarly work. The aim is to provide a wider forum for
  these students’ work and to illustrate the intellectual integrity of incarcerated
  students’ academic potential in ways that are not reflected in the existing publishing
  platforms. By highlighting their ability to see connections across disparate texts,
  to situate their experiences within the context of a broader intellectual history,
  and to use theoretical texts as prisms to deepen and expand the meaning and significance
  of a range of evidence, this project hopes to contribute to the reshaping of perceptions
  and understanding of the incarcerated.
