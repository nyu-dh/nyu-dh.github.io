abstract: Kalinago Living Language is a digitization and translation project that
  endeavors to reformat and improve access to Indigenous Kalinago language resources
  by producing a lexical repository and user-friendly dictionary website. The pilot
  seeks to first compile a dataset from a corpus of printed evangelization materials
  created by Raymond Breton, a French missionary in the seventeenth-century Caribbean.
  We will lift entries from an OCRenabled PDF of a critical edition of Bretonâ€™s Kalinago-French
  dictionary. Using Transkribus, an AI text recognition and transcription tool trained
  on historical manuscripts, we will also transcribe text from a French- Kalinago
  dictionary, a grammar, and a catechism, available in digitized rare books formats.
  The goal is to comprehensively translate, using collaborative and machine translation,
  French text into English to generate a direct Kalinago-to-English vocabulary dataset.
  Once this dataset is complete, we will build a user interface structured as a searchable
  and browsable dictionary. The landing page of this online dictionary will offer
  a historical and linguistic framing of the project. We anticipate that this resource
  will not only be of interest to linguists, historians, and anthropologists in the
  anglophone academy, but also to English-speaking descendent communities living in
  the eastern Caribbean.
