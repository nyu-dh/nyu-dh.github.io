abstract: This project compiles extracted, machine-readable entries from a series
  of New York City directories digitized by the New York Public Library that listed
  the names, occupations or type of business performed by that individual, work address,
  and often the individual's home address or home town for thousands of residents
  of the city. Included directories are John Doggett's New York City Directory (1850
  and 1851) and John Trow's The Directory of the City of New-York compiled by Henry
  Wilson (1852-1890).
