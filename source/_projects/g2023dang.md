abstract: At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States proclaimed an Open
  Door Policy that sought to protect China’s territorial integrity and governmental
  sovereignty amid fears that inter-imperial scrambles for territory would implode
  global capitalism. Why would the US proclaim an anti-imperial policy at a time when
  its settler colonial empire spread deeper into the Western Hemisphere and into the
  Pacific world? This project proposes that the premise of defending China’s territorial
  sovereignty articulated a new geopolitical strategy that sought progressive modernization
  and developmental aid without “formal” colonization. Amid uneven treaties that ceded
  land to foreign powers and various domestic frontier disputes, China’s very territory
  and government needed to be remade and US corporations and policymakers staked a
  share in this future. Rather than begin with the established borders, I digitize
  the construction of territorial sovereignty of China through significant agricultural,
  exploratory, pedagogical, and journalistic projects from the declaration of the
  Open Door in 1899 to the establishment of a territorially bounded communist state
  in 1949. This project draws upon digital humanities techniques to create an interactive
  map to show that the division of the world into nation-states was not merely the
  work of diplomats and statesmen, but required a variety of actors such as explorers,
  journalists, and researchers. Ultimately, I show how territorial sovereignty needed
  to be built anew through the collaboration between a progressive US imperialism
  and Chinese nationalism as geopolitics is not merely diplomatic relations but the
  political and material creation of new geographies.
