abstract: Yanacocha, named in Quechua after the “black” lake that formerly occupied
  the site, was once the largest gold mine in South America. Today, the mine’s 251-square
  kilometer open-pit reserves is almost entirely depleted. Yanacocha’s three decades
  of extraction have led to drastic changes in the surrounding landscapes with trends
  of rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. As the project enters its last
  phase of operations, “closure plans” are activated to address the enduring environmental
  and social legacy of the mine. This digital humanities project develops an interactive
  virtual timeline that 1. Visualizes the changes to the landscape produce by large-scale
  mineral extraction projects and 2. Tracks the promises and post-closure commitments
  to corporate social responsibility made by Newmont, the American corporation in
  charge of the project, alongside dissenting claims by local and indigenous activists.
  Drawing on materials included in environmental impact reports (EIAs) and closure
  plans submitted for public review, I restructure these documents to challenge their
  associations with imperial capitalist interests. The elements of these reports (their
  photographs, maps, and modeled plans) become evidence of irreparably-changed landscapes
  and of the limits of these formats to meaningfully address the “alterlives” of extractivism.
  My curation of the virtual space also acknowledges and includes the claims of activist
  groups, as featured in local journalistic accounts and international human rights
  reports. The timeline then allows for a political encounter that challenges the
  limited scales of corporate accountability and explores the contested potential
  of post-extractive time.
