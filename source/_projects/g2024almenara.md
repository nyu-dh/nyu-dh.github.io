abstract: Yanacocha, named in Quechua after the “black” lake that formerly occupied
  the site, was once the largest gold and silver mine in South America. Today, the
  mine’s 251-square kilometer open-pit reserves are almost entirely depleted. Yanacocha’s
  three decades of extraction have led to drastic changes in the surrounding landscapes
  with trends of rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. As the project
  enters its last phase of operations, “closure plans” are activated to address the
  enduring environmental and social legacy of the mine. This digital humanities project
  develops an interactive virtual timeline that 1. Visualizes the changes to the landscape
  produce by large-scale mineral extraction projects and 2. Critically considers the
  proposed strategies for environmental remediation and their own implications to
  local politics and ecosystems. Drawing on Landsat satellite images and closure plans
  submitted for public review on behalf of Newmont, the American mining corporation
  which currently manages the mine, I develop a new visual record that evidences the
  concrete impacts of foreign investment on the Andean territory and challenges the
  discursive framing of “environmental protection” within neoliberal capitalist logics.
