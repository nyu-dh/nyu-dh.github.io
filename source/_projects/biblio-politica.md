abstract: Biblio-Política is a virtual exhibit that documents and shares the story
  of the Chicano Studies Library at UC Berkeley, one of the first dedicated Chicano
  Studies libraries in the United States. The project will digitize and make available
  early library ephemera, photos, and records documenting the library’s unique knowledge
  organizing system, and create original oral history interviews with some of the
  library’s early staff. The custom designed exhibit will amplify the little-known
  stories of innovative library workers while showcasing each digital object with
  detailed metadata. The exhibit will be built using Wax, an extensible software that
  can easily be maintained and later stored in a dedicated repository.
