abstract: Scholars in the humanities and social sciences alike have hypothesized that
  psychotherapists work not only to heal their clients’ maladies, but also to mold
  and shape the character of their selves. Arguing that psychotherapists seek to mold
  their clients in their visions of a “model man” (Foucault 1963), scholars contend
  that therapists seek to orient their clients’ selves, or core identities and modes
  of being, thinking, and feeling, toward distinct ends. Yet while scholars agree
  that psychotherapists seek to shape the self, they diverge regarding to which ends
  therapists seek to shape it. Do therapists seek to craft selves that are individualistic
  and autonomous, or selves that are embedded within the family? (Rose 1998; Weinstein
  2013). Is the ideal self an emotional and expressive self, or an introspective and
  inward-looking one? (Rieff 1996; Illouz 2008). This project will adjudicate these
  debates by exploring how therapists depict the traits of their clients in a novel
  dataset of 80,000 psychotherapy advertisements. Using text analysis to engage in
  a distant reading of these ads, I will explore the characteristics therapists suggest
  mark a self as either a desirable self towards which one can strive in therapy or
  an undesirable self that merits therapeutic modification. Then, I will explore whether
  images of the ideal self vary based on therapists’ specializations. This research
  will refresh scholarship on psychotherapy and the self with new empirical findings
  and produce a novel analysis of an important but under-researched cultural formation,
  the twenty-first-century online mental healthcare marketplace.
