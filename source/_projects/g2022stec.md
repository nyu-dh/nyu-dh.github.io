abstract: The Brownies’ Book Archive is a digital archive and exhibit of W.E.B. Du
  Bois and Jessie Redmon Fauset’s children’s magazine, The Brownies’ Book (1920-1921),
  the first periodical published for Black children. The Brownies’ Book Archive will
  make this vital record of early-twentieth-century Black childhood more accessible
  to students, scholars, and the public, highlight potential avenues of scholarly
  study, and enable users to explore the often-overlooked work of female artists of
  the Harlem Renaissance. Using HTML and PHP to customize Omeka’s CSS, The Brownies’
  Book Archive will comprise two archival collections in which readers can browse
  text-searchable PDFs of the magazine by issue and by type of content (poetry, photographs,
  etc.); a guide to work by female contributors; a GIS map and essay detailing the
  geographical distribution of Brownies’ Book readers and its socioeconomic and sociocultural
  implications; and a user’s guide explaining how to navigate the site, how information
  was digitized and analyzed, and ideas for how to use the resource. The project’s
  centerpiece will be a comprehensive exhibit detailing how The Brownies’ Book’s portrayal
  of Black individuals differed from two of its most widely-read contemporaries, St.
  Nicholas and The Youth’s Companion. This exhibit will use text analysis to examine
  links between race, respectability, and action in each periodical by exploring topic
  modeling and examining the adjectives and nouns used by each magazine to characterize
  Black and white individuals, the verbs ascribed to Black and white individuals’
  actions, and the frequency with which Black individuals appear in the periodicals’
  texts.
