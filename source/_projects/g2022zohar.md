abstract: 'Looking at a number of publications from research institutes and publishing
  houses in the Arab world from 1948 to 1982, this project hopes to map the circulation
  of Mizrahi texts in the Arab world. In order to attend to the roles of different
  actors in the publication process, the project will detail how these works’ physical
  circulation, material dimensions, and intertextual relationships were integral to
  these texts’ reception. The project will use digital platforms such as Omeka in
  order to map, catalog, selectively digitize (in accordance with fair use guidelines),
  contextualize, and crucially, relate works published in English, French, Hebrew,
  and Arabic on Mizrahi thought. In the process, it hopes to ask: why and how have
  Arab intellectuals written about the Mizrahi struggle in Israel? Despite their purported
  focus on “the enemy,” many of these works translate and endorse the views of Mizrahi
  social movements; emphasize historic ties of Jewish communities with their co-citizens
  of other faiths in the Arab world; and elevate non-Zionist Jewish voices on the
  Palestinian Question. Indeed, all of the works in question argue that the stakes
  and impact of Mizrahi struggle are relevant, either as a part of or an obstacle
  to, the Palestinian struggle against Zionism. Rather than seeing Mizrahim and Palestinians
  as separate populations brought together only through their common position as oppressed,
  this study hopes to center these actors themselves showing how they engaged–even
  after their separation by partition and the hardening of borders–with each other
  and with broader global and regional intellectual currents such as Continental existentialism,
  Communism, Arab leftism, and Third Worldist thought.'
