abstract: The South African Jewish Cookbook Project will digitize a corpus of 50 community
  cookbooks, created by South African Jewish women during the apartheid era. It will
  unite the cookbooks, collected from a broad range of institutions and private individuals
  spread across the globe, into a single digital collection. The project will present
  the cookbooks on a curated website, where users will be able to search, browse,
  and interact with the books, and read a series of interlinked encyclopedia-style
  articles exploring the wider significance of the cookbook corpus for South African
  and Jewish culture, history, and culinary practice. The project will be of particular
  value to members of the South African Jewish diaspora, particularly those interested
  in culinary heritage, communal history, and genealogical research, as well as for
  scholars working on topics relating to South Africa, food, Judaism, race, gender,
  and the postwar period. It will actively engage the public, encouraging users to
  contribute cookbooks and share written and video memories relating to the cookbooks
  and to South African Jewish food culture.
