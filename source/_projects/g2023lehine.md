abstract: 'During the Fall 2022 semester, I took part in the course “Advanced Seminar:
  Cinema & the Digital Humanities” taught by Marina Hassapopoulou. For this course’s
  final assignment, I created a project titled Museum for Ukraine, a prototype virtual
  reality (VR) / mouse-and-keyboard digital museum hosted on the Mozilla Hubs platform
  which consisted primarily of Ukrainian monuments and objects of material culture.
  These artifacts, digitized by artists and activists as a part of the Backup Ukraine
  UNESCO program, are currently being hosted on the website polycam.com where they
  can be interacted with via a fairly standard “click and drag” web-based 3D model
  viewer. The shortcomings of this setup (lack of search features, lack of qualitative
  information, limited interaction paradigm, etc.) inspired me to create the virtual
  museum—to bring the objects together into a curated digital space where users could
  be with the objects in a compelling and immersive way. With the help of a DH summer
  fellowship, I seek to take this intervention to the next level by expanding upon
  my prototype, along the way generating papers that explore the origin stories of
  these digital monuments, the art and activism of their digitizers, digital cultural
  preservation, and/or VR critical making pedagogy. With this project, it is my goal
  to create a digital home for these objects that preserves and presents them in a
  meaningful way, one which by design affords users the opportunity to make empathetic
  connections with them and continues the task of raising awareness for Ukraine’s
  struggle.'
