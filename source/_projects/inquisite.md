abstract: Closely aligned with the objects of NewYorkScapes to provide support for
  the creation, design, and preservation of humanities data, support for the software
  platform Inquisite is being sought to facilitate the use of research data in the
  classroom and on long-term project development. Data and discipline agnostic, the
  platform is intended to fill needs among faculty and researchers for a low-technology-barrier
  interface for hosting and documenting data iteratively for research management purposes.
