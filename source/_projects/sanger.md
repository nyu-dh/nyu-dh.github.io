abstract: The Margaret Sanger Papers Project is a historical editing project formed
  by Esther Katz and sponsored by the NYU's Department of History and Division of
  Libraries to locate, arrange, edit, research, and publish the papers of the noted
  birth control pioneer. The project has published a two-series edition and a four-volume
  book edition of Sanger's Papers as a result of work rearranging and organizing over
  50,000 documents and a ten-year international search of over 1,500 archives and
  private collection.
