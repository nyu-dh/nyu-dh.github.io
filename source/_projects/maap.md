abstract: The Mapping Artistic Activism Project (MAAP) is a living digital archive
  of individuals, collectives, and organizations engaged in the emerging field of
  artistic activism in different regions around the world. This archive will identify
  connections between actors across territories and detail the challenges faced by
  practitioners as described by themselves. MAAP will allow us to understand the ecosystem
  of artistic activism and the main tendencies defining its growth. Using Mapbox Studio
  software and WordPress integration, MAAPâ€™s end product will be a public-facing,
  easy-to-use website that graphically "maps" the field of artistic activism across
  the globe, yet allows the user to drill down to explore in detail different practitioners
  and organizations. Using original data gathered by a network of international researchers
  and self-generated by practitioners around the world, this platform will be a resource
  for researchers, practitioners, educators, supporters, and funders looking to understand
  and strengthen the practice of and knowledge about artistic activism worldwide.
