abstract: Focusing on the the nineteenth-century bryological Mitten Collection at
  the New York Botanical Garden, this project uses moss—one of the most commonplace
  and adaptive plants in the world—to explore how experimental digital imaging techniques
  and pluralistic storytelling might be applied to colonial botanical collections
  to open up ways to critically interrogate violent systems of classification and
  order. Intersecting the history of science, critical archival studies, and recent
  interventions into decolonizing design, this digital humanities project uses a specific
  set of sources (ranging from archival and manuscript materials to herbarium specimens)
  to ask how women, indigenous experts, and working-class collectors’ contributions
  to the history of botany have been subsumed and silenced in the service of natural
  historical “authorship”—in this case, by the British bryologist William Mitten (1819-1906).
  By engaging a multitude of stakeholders across various fields and levels of expertise,
  this public-facing project explores how reading moss from multiple perspectives
  can engender new systems of knowledge production crossing colonial natural history,
  museum and archival studies, and decolonial design practices.

  The topic's not obviously boss;
  But with history and our secret sauce
  of decolonial design,
  and critical archives, you'll find
  That your worldview will be changed by some moss.
