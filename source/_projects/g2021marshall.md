abstract: Marshall created a digital walking tour of Old City Philadelphia that features
  white and Black churches and graveyards. Through a mobile-friendly website and a
  guided audio component, she contextualized, challenged, and added to the existing
  historical narrative of these sites in a way that is accessible and engaging for
  tourists and locals alike. This project is a continuation of her undergraduate thesis,
  which was published in 2020 in "Pennsylvania History."
