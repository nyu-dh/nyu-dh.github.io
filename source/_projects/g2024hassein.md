abstract: 'My dissertation project, “Arabic-based programming languages and communities”,
  consists of several distinct methodological and thematic components: the history
  of the titular genre of software artifact; digital ethnographic work in two open
  source programming communities which have dedicated themselves to multilingual inclusion
  via translation of documentation; in person ethnographic work in both a bilingual
  Arabic-English NYC public school and an Egyptian school; and a media theorization
  based in Arabic programming practice. I am seeking the support of the NYU Digital
  Humanities Graduate Fellowship to spend the majority of my time this summer on building
  a publicly accessible bilingual English-Arabic digital archive of Arabic-based programming
  languages, as a basis for writing a conference paper in the near term before eventually
  a journal article and dissertation chapter on the history of Arabic-based programming
  languages. I also hope this summer to continue to contribute to the translation
  of programming documentation from English into Arabic as a means of further immersion
  into the communities I am dedicated to researching, and to begin recording ethnographic
  data about those communities of translators in particular and programmers/learners
  more broadly. This project builds on my undergraduate study of computer science,
  professional experience as a software developer and teacher, graduate training in
  media studies and allied fields such as science and technology studies and semiotics,
  and post-advanced study of my heritage language of Arabic, in order to interrogate
  the interrelationships among language, culture, and computing, and help imagine
  and build a future of linguistic diversity and justice in the field.'
