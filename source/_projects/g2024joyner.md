abstract: This project will be a digital dance archive that not only holds the visual
  work on a website but also includes the choreographers’ intent of the work and the
  current audience’s interpretation of the work. There will be a sheet sent out to
  each choreographer, where they will detail the themes and symbols they deem important
  in the dance they created on the sheet. From these themes and symbols questions
  will be formed and logged into a polling software called PollEverywhere. Guests
  will be invited to a showing with the understanding that they will have the opportunity
  to share their in the moment/live interpretations of the dances during the show.
  They will also be informed about the archiving of the data and have the option to
  remain anonymous. To be clear, the audience will not be sharing opinions about the
  work or conducting critics, the only data that will be shared is those who answer
  the questions given. The guest will be given a QR code to scan to access the poll
  through the show in between each dance piece the audience will have a set amount
  of time to complete the questions for each dance piece. The dance pieces will be
  filmed and footage will be uploaded alongside the data and details of each dance
  piece on the website. The audience will only have a title and the visual experience
  as reference to the dance piece they will see therefore no bias is likely to take
  place.
