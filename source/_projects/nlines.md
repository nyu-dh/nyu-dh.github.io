abstract: 'n Lines and Changing is an ongoing digital poetry project that arises from
  nearly 15 years of living in Shanghai, and which I use the expanding Shanghai Metro
  system as a compositional tool which both guides explorations of the city and which
  shapes the composition of a digital poem. I use chance procedures to determine destinations
  within Shanghai''s sprawling Metro system (currently 506 stations, with more opening
  soon, and 19 active lines, with more planned). I then do an "algorithmic walk" determined
  by chance procedures. The goal is to "write the city" in line with its constant,
  dynamic, ongoing change. I do not intend to "finish" in the conventional sense,
  but keep it "open" as I take new trips, and as new lines and stations are added,
  and as collaborators join (including, eventually, via a public app). I would use
  this grant to take it from its current proof-of-concept stage and to launch it publicly,
  both online and in talks, readings and lectures. The grant would allow me to develop
  and expand the site (adding documentation, photography, video and sound recordings,
  a Chinese translation "toggle," and a critical essay). '
