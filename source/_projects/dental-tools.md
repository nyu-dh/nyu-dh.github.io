abstract: Imagine a digital museum where artifacts appear in virtual reality in three
  dimensions and can be manipulated for full inspection. The College of Dentistry
  is creating such a museum by 3D scanning and digitizing its artifacts using the
  services of the LaGuardia Studio for high resolution scanning and a novel 3D display
  software called Sketchfab, to manipulate objects in space. The current effort is
  one of the very few in the World to utilize such technology for museum artifacts.
