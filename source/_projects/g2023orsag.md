abstract: Cartography and geography fulfilled a crucial role in the process of colonization
  of the Western Amazon rainforest. Most of us have seen maps from the region scratched
  with international boundaries dividing the region between Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,
  Peru, and Bolivia minimizing or completely erasing indigenous territories. Nineteenth-century
  maps mostly detail rivers and resource areas that could be exploited; the information
  maps displayed correlated with the advance and desires of colonization and the geographies
  of capitalism. The goal of this project is to begin a historical cartography that
  completely shifts our geographical perception of the Amazon rainforest while visualizing
  the ongoing process of colonization of the region. The Amazon was never empty, indigenous
  territories or even indigenous populations in voluntary isolation that still lived
  today on the Amazon are evidence of the resistance to colonization. However, through
  digital tools and a reorganization of the information displayed on maps, it is possible
  to shift their purpose and visualize the historical process of colonization, thereby
  countering the processes that have attempted to make invisible the indigenous history
  of this region. With the digital humanities summer funding, I will finish a small-scale
  sample database of settlements in the Amazon, a database for commercial routes,
  and a database for indigenous territories. The databases will be displayed on six
  maps one for each decade from 1850 to 1912 to visualize the transformation and colonization
  of the indigenous territories in the Western Amazon.
