cohort_year: '2021'
abstract: 'This project focused on gathering and developing knitting patterns that
  would encourage the use of circuit building. The target audience it teen girls,
  but for the start Busser focused on any crafters with an interest in science education.
  She tried to think of the most basic pattern that she could augment with wearable
  technology. Subset plans and next steps include developing a database that focuses
  on how arts can be used in conjunction with activism (also known as craftivism)
  and resources to expand resource accessibility to artists and educators working
  in the field. '
