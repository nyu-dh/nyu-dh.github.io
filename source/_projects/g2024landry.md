abstract: "‘Only your labels split me’: Finding Mestizaje in Archival Metadata and
  Description is a text analysis project that seeks to collect, code, and visualize
  archival descriptions of mestizos, mulattos, and other people racialized as “mixed”
  in New Spain (with an emphasis on present-day Mexico and the American Southwest).
  The NYU DH Graduate Fellowship supported the foundational data collection and coding
  phases of this project, which I will continue to develop as my capstone project
  for the Archives and Public History MA program. Using Texas Archival Resources Online
  (TARO), a database of finding aids for archival collections housed in Texas, I collected
  a sample of finding aids which I uploaded to ATLAS.ti, a qualitative data analysis
  software, to code concepts and descriptions of cultural and racial “mixing” that
  appear within them. This project builds on ongoing movements within the archives
  field to 1) envision archival description as structured data rather than prose and
  2) investigate and remediate harmful language historically used by archivists to
  describe Black, Indigenous, and people of color. While digital humanities tools
  have mostly been used as platforms for presenting digital exhibitions and archival
  collections, I believe there is significant potential to use data analysis and visualization
  to produce new insights into how archivists are categorizing and describing BIPOC
  archival actors, particularly those who have historically disrupted Eurocentric
  racial hierarchies. By approaching archival description with Gloria Anzaldúa’s concept
  of mestiza consciousness – “a holistic, nonbinary way of thinking…that includes
  a transformational tolerance for contradiction” – this project intends to spark
  critical reflections among archivists about how we can responsibly and ethically
  create metadata for records involving mixed-race archival actors who were not only
  marginalized at the time they were recorded in the archive but also continue to
  defy Western racial hierarchies that are taken for granted in U.S. archival descriptive
  practices."
