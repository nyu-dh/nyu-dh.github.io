abstract: Mestizaje on the Map is an interdisciplinary digital humanities project
  that seeks to analyze and visualize descriptive metadata created by archivists to
  describe historical records regarding mestizos, mulattos, and other people racialized
  as “mixed” in colonial Texas. By using qualitative data analysis software to code
  concepts and descriptions of cultural and racial “mixing” that appear in online
  finding aids and digital object descriptions, I hope to understand how mestizaje
  is represented in archival descriptive metadata. This project builds on ongoing
  movements within the archives field to 1) envision archival description as structured
  data rather than prose and 2) investigate and remediate harmful language historically
  used by archivists to describe Black, Indigenous, and people of color. While digital
  humanities tools have mostly been used as platforms for presenting digital exhibitions
  and archival collections, I believe there is significant potential to use data analysis
  and visualization to produce new insights into how archivists are categorizing and
  describing BIPOC archival actors, particularly those who have historically disrupted
  Eurocentric racial hierarchies. By approaching archival description with Gloria
  Anzaldúa’s concept of mestiza consciousness – “a holistic, nonbinary way of thinking…that
  includes a transformational tolerance for contradiction” – Mestizaje on the Map
  intends to spark critical reflections among archivists about how we can responsibly
  and ethically create metadata for records involving mixed-race archival actors.
