abstract: 'Since 2020, the language surrounding transgender women in American media
  outlets has become increasingly vitriolic through the misrecognition and subsequent
  projection of a threatening transfemininity. While violence against trans women
  is unfortunately nothing new, transmisogyny has only relatively recently become
  a viral phenomenon in mainstream news outlets. Alarmingly, the recent rise in transmisogynistic
  rhetoric in the news coincides with a resurgence of reactionary populism and the
  mainstreaming of conspiratorial rhetoric. As organized transphobia increasingly
  relies on the discursive myth of a “silent majority” to provide cover for its political
  program, transgender women have become the latest bogeymen for the far-right. This
  current wave of organized transphobia includes language pulled from anti-semitic
  conspiracy theories slightly shifted for a new scapegoat. My project implements
  a textual coding schema via  which to analyze the news, in order to create a map
  of the conspiratorial rhetoric underpinning [this new media landscape of transmisogyny.
  Using MAXQDA, I will analyze aggregated news articles using discursive and sentiment
  analysis. This project will address language and linguistic forms only, pulling
  sample articles discussing transgender issues from popular news sites in the United
  States, identifying common tropes, including: transgressing the mainstream, the
  creation of recency, appeal to reason, the weaponization of children , anecdotal
  language, and moral appeals to tradition. Following this period of qualitative coding,
  I will build a conclusive rubric on how to recognize organized transmisogyny, hosting
  an interactive map of the compiled data online. '
