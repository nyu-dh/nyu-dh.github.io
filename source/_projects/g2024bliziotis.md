abstract: 'Since 2020, the language surrounding transgender women in American media
  outlets has become increasingly vitriolic through the misrecognition and projection
  of a threatening trans-femininity. While violence against trans women is unfortunately
  nothing new, trans-misogyny has only relatively recently become a viral phenomenon
  in mainstream news outlets. I propose a textual coding schema in which to analyze
  the news and create a map of the rhetoric it draws on to address this new media
  landscape of trans-misogyny. Utilizing Python and Intelligent Archive, I will analyze
  aggregated news articles using discursive analysis and sentiment analysis. This
  project will address language and linguistic forms only, pulling sample articles
  discussing trans women from the ten most-visited news sites in the United States
  from January 2023 onward. My analysis identifies common features in popular American
  news stories regarding trans women: stereotypes, passive language, misleading language,
  inaccurate statistics, false balance or faux-neutrality, and false dichotomies.
  Following this period of qualitative coding, I will build a conclusive rubric on
  how to recognize trans-misogynistic language and rhetoric, hosting an interactive
  map of the compiled data online.'
