abstract: "“Arts of the Errant Americas” proposes a pilot program for a series of
  annual digital humanities art exhibitions that aim to reroute the standard narrative
  of “American art” by emphasizing unvoiced or silenced stories. Hosted by the Institute
  of Fine Arts (IFA), NYU, the program provides a broad remit for student curators
  to mount online exhibitions across chronology and media that reconsider the standard
  classification of American art typically confined to tight sociopolitical boundaries,
  such as stable notions of nationality, class, and race. By organizing exhibitions
  concentrating on underrepresented communities, this project foregrounds diversity,
  equity, and inclusion. With the funds from the seed grant, we will build an expandable
  website to host the annual exhibitions, secure digitization tools for future use,
  and curate a prototype exhibition to inaugurate the website and demonstrate the
  wide offerings of the digital world for art humanities. This exhibition will center
  on Chicana artist Yreina Cervántez’s recently restored mural La Ofrenda (1989).
  Cervántez was selected as the first artist in this series due to her institutional
  neglect despite her significant impact on the Central American community in Los
  Angeles. This exhibition is a platform for increased appreciation of her contribution
  to Latinx arts and a prompt to develop compelling solutions to translate her murals
  into the digital."
