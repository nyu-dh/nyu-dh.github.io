abstract: "Visioning Provisioning is a project that investigates and creates a visual
  representation of the food provisioning practices of food insecure New Yorkers.
  Food provisioning is defined as the “mental, physical and emotional labor involved
  in providing food for oneself and one’s family.” It is required daily, and made
  more difficult by socioeconomic and geographic constraints (Meierotto and Castellano,
  2020). This project explores the possibility of using maps to visualize the labor
  involved in sourcing food for families living with food insecurity. My prior research
  has shown that food insecure households expend an excess of time and energy each
  week figuring out how to stretch resources, such as limited funds, limited transportation,
  SNAP benefits, and food distribution opportunities. This project is born from my
  experience teaching food systems to undergraduates and seeing how for those who
  have not experienced food insecurity, the labor involved in food provisioning is
  much easier to comprehend when represented geospatially. My ambition for this project
  is to conduct create a resource that opens eyes to the often invisible lived experience
  of individuals navigating New York City’s food systems. With qualitative data collected
  through in-depth interviews, photo logs and food journals, I have created maps that
  chart food provisioning routes of the participants in my study. These maps include
  the costs associated with locations, and visual and textual insight about the impact
  of the process on emotional and physical wellbeing. However, in some cases, the
  map proved to not to be the ideal representation. In those instances, I have used
  timelines and direct quotes to illustrate experience. \n\nIt is a failure of our
  food system that some New Yorkers must spend an undue amount of time and energy
  providing food for their families. I believe representing this failure is imperative
  for fighting narratives about individualized responsibility for food insecurity
  and diet-related diseases. The potential for this project extends beyond the classroom,
  as it could become a tool for food policy analysts and advocates. It is my most
  ambitious hope that creating a resource for students and change makers to see this
  process is a step towards reforming the food system."
