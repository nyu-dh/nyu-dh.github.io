abstract: Seeing Food (in)Access is a project that investigates and creates a visual
  representation of the food provisioning practices of food insecure New Yorkers.
  Food provisioning is defined as the “mental, physical and emotional labor involved
  in providing food for oneself and one’s family.” It is required daily, and made
  more difficult by socioeconomic and geographic constraints (Meierotto and Castellano,
  2020). This project uses ArcGIS story maps to visualize the labor involved in sourcing
  food for families living with food insecurity. My research has shown that food insecure
  households expend an excess of time and energy each week figuring out how to stretch
  resources, such as limited funds, limited transportation, SNAP benefits, and food
  distribution opportunities. For those who have not experienced food insecurity,
  the labor involved in this provisioning is much easier to comprehend when represented
  geospatially. My ambition for this project is to conduct research and create a resource
  that opens eyes to the lived experience of how food insecure individuals navigate
  New York City’s food systems. The project will result in maps that chart food provisioning
  routes, including the costs associated with each location, and visual and textual
  insight about the impact of the process on emotional and physical wellbeing. It
  is a failure of our food system that some New Yorkers must spend an undue amount
  of time and energy providing food for their families. Creating a resource for changemakers
  to understand this process is a step towards reforming the food system.
