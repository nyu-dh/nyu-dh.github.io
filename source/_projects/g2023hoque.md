abstract: "Due to proprietary rights and black-boxing, it is not possible for researchers
  to study how private companies or the state construct AI Judges, i.e., using artificial
  intelligence to generate legal judgments/verdicts. To get around this problem, I
  applied Alexander Galloway’s method – algorithmic reenactment (2021) – which draws
  from the digital humanities to build a small-scale prototype AI Judge and understand
  the possibilities and limitations of code/coding. The goal for this project is not
  about creating the “perfect” AI Judge, but rather noting the biases and gaps within
  these processes from an encoder’s standpoint. In building an AI Judge first-hand,
  I was able to understand how the core component of this model relies on training
  AI to follow the decision-making patterns of elite courts and trace how the offline
  biases of the higher court records are reinscribed online during the automation
  process. \n \n Digital humanities have used computational techniques to generate
  new interdisciplinary methods in various fields, but there is an absence/resistance
  of it in anthropology. My project bridges the dialogue within the digital humanities
  and anthropology to develop a method – prototyping as ethnographic method – as a
  means to study block-boxed algorithmic technologies. I will dedicate a chapter of
  my dissertation about this method and intend to develop it during the NYU Digital
  Humanities Summer Grant. I already spoke with the editor of American Anthropologist
  and they expressed interest in publishing this chapter as a journal article in the
  Multimodal Anthropologies section after peer-review."
