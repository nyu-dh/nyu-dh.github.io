abstract: My doctoral dissertation explores the shortcomings of AI Judges, that is,
  when artificial intelligence is used to generate the legal verdicts of cases. Due
  to blackboxing and proprietary rights, it is not possible for a researcher to study
  how AI Judge models and other automated technologies are being built by states or
  private tech companies. To bypass this issue, I started building a prototype AI
  Judge model to have a hands-on approach, allowing for a more immersive means to
  understand the possibilities and limitations of code/coding. My NYU Digital Humanities
  project – "Prototyping as Ethnography" – is a paper that bridges the methods of
  Digital Humanities and Anthropology to conceptualize how ethnography can be broadened
  to include prototyping. The goal of this project was not to create the “perfect”
  AI Judge model, but rather having an immersive and hands-on approach to engaging
  with programming language and learn how code “behaves.” My method is connected to
  anthropologists Rabinow and Bennet’s work on how participant observation can include
  researchers conducting their own experiments in the laboratory. I also draw from
  Galloway’s method of ‘algorithmic reenactment’ which promotes re-enacting code from
  archives and Hartman’s ‘critical fabulation’ which proposes that researchers might
  have to fill in the gaps of archives by imagining what might have happened when
  there is no way to know otherwise. The goal is to map new ways of diversity in critical
  thinking, rupturing methodological and theoretical boundaries to locate and analyze
  findings.
