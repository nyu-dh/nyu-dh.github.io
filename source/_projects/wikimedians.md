abstract: Wikimedians @ NYU Libraries, founded January 2019, is an informal group
  of colleagues within the Division of Libraries who work to develop library initiatives
  related to the Wiki worldâ€”for example, workshops for staff about how to add citations
  to a Wikipedia page, or how to query and contribute to Wikidata. The group has also
  supported Edit-a-thon events for faculty and students.
