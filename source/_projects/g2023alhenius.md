abstract: The Archives of Virtual Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Mexico Nineteenth-century
  Mexico was one of the first and most radical abolitionist nations in the Americas,
  where elites constructed a national identity grounded on racial inclusion and antislavery.
  Nevertheless, throughout this period, various forms of forced labor and racial subjugation
  flourished in Mexico’s borderland regions of Texas, Yucatán, and Chiapas. These
  practices of bondage, indenture, and peonage were legally ambiguous, yet practically
  difficult to distinguish from slavery. While scholars have mentioned in passing
  many of the documents that attested to this traffic, none have given an in-depth
  analysis of the documents that attest to these forms of subjugation. Many of these
  documents are contracts that employers used to maintain a pretense of “free labor”
  relations, including simulating the workers’ consent. This summer project has focused
  on digitizing and transcribing these documents and adding metadata using optical
  character recognition (OCR) software through Transkribus. Publicly available AI
  transcription models on Transkribus were trained on handwritten documents date to
  15th and 16th-century Spain. I have dedicated most of my time to training an AI
  language model on 19th-century documents in Spanish from archives in the Mexico,
  the U.S., Guatemala, and Spain. I have then used this model to then transcribe hundreds
  of pages of archival documents related to the trafficking of laborers across Mexico’s
  borders and make them fully searchable. This work will make these documents more
  publicly accessible and easy to use for other scholars interested in indenture on
  Mexico’s borderlands.
