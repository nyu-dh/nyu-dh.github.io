abstract: My project with the NYU Digital Humanities Summer Fellowship will use ArcGIS,
  Zotero, and a publishing platform (I hope to explore WordPress, StoryMaps, and Wax
  as options) to map, categorize, and transcribe the core sources for my dissertation
  on forced labor and race in nineteenth-century México. I will also explore the use
  of OCR software for transcribing digitized documents. One significant aspect of
  my dissertation is to understand why the persistence of slavery and race have remained
  illegible in nineteenth-century Mexican history, culture, and national identity.
  This project brings together a body of original sources consisting of archival documents,
  printed materials, and photography that will make the under-studied question of
  slavery and forced labor on nineteenth-century Mexico’s borderlands accessible to
  other scholars. The final product will be a website that uses GIS to plot these
  sources together on a map that provides the location of the archives and documents,
  relevant metadata, and transcribed archival documents, so that their geographical
  and thematic relationships can be intuitively explored.
