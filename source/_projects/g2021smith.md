abstract: 'Smith''s dissertation explores how police and prosecutors use civil forfeiture
  to wage the drug war in Philadelphia. Forfeiture operates through the legal fiction
  of guilty property, meaning that property can be seized even if its owner is not
  charged with a crime. The practice was adopted by law enforcement officials in Philadelphia
  during the 1980s to seize cash, cars, and homes allegedly implicated in criminalized
  narcotics transactions. The city has used these seized assets to fund more intensive
  policing in the racially segregated and disinvested neighborhoods where forfeitures
  are spatially concentrated. Public officials defend forfeiture by claiming that
  seized assets have the capacity to cause harm. However, through ethnographic research
  on police practices and in forfeiture courtrooms, he found that forfeiture operated
  through a racializing framework of moral remediation and punitive dispossession.
  Based on my extensive archival research, he also found that Philadelphia prosecutors
  forfeited 1,696 homes—many taken from Black and Latinx women and auctioned to developers—and
  earned over $80 million through the seizure of cash between the early 1990s and
  2018. The Digital Humanities Graduate Student Summer Fellowship was used to map
  incidents of home and cash forfeiture in Philadelphia in relation to spatial measures
  of racial inequality. These GIS products aimed to visually convey a central thesis
  of his dissertation: that police manage, maintain, and reproduce racial inequality
  in the contemporary American city. He ultimately argues that forfeiture represents
  a regulatory state intervention into the urban drug economy that reproduces racial
  segregation and fuels urban redevelopment.'
