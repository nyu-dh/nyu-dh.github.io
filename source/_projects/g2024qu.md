abstract: My research looks into how temporality in Parenting Simulation Games (PSG)
  impacts the simulation of kinship. Building off my research, I developed a text-based
  PSG that explores an alternative way of simulation by incorporating a non-linear
  topographic time. In classic PSGs, the player takes care of a child by allocating
  their limited lifetime to different activities to reach specific career and marriage
  endings. Although extremely time-consuming, it is common for the players to micromanage
  every moment of their child’s life trajectory to achieve their desired results through
  the function of saving and restoration. Time as an infrastructure in this circumstance
  determines a highly teleological simulation of parental care because the more time
  the players invest in programming the process, the more importance is granted to
  the endings. To push back this logic in simulation, I developed a Twine-based PSG
  that incorporates a topological temporality that downplays the achievements of the
  result and emphasizes on fostering care. In my game, the parent no longer has the
  power to determine the child’s life but has the power to rebuild the emotional connection
  between them by recollecting scattered memories. This project allows me to gain
  perspective as a game developer and thus contribute to my larger research project
  on the simulation of parent-child kinship.
