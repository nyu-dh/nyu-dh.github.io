abstract: Baby simulation games are a subcategory of life simulation games that are
  built around the life trajectory of their playable character(s), such as the Princess
  Maker series (first released in 1991), Chinese Parents (2018), and Growing Up (2021).
  By continuously making decisions for their virtual babies, players lead their playable
  characters into periodical and terminal results. During the gaming process, the
  players simultaneously identify as the parent and caretaker of the characters and
  as the characters themselves, creating an elastic, dynamic, and posthuman relationship.
  However, these games also usually depend on a teleological logic that implies not
  only that there are certain life goals every individual must reach, but also that
  certain life outcomes are better than others. My project will first look into the
  history of baby simulation games to study how the hardware of gaming consoles and
  algorithmic culture interact with the understanding of caregiving in contemporary
  American popular culture. Then, After the research, I plan on using game design
  tools such as Twine or Renâ€™Py to create a baby simulation game to explore if there
  is a way to build on this tradition of encouraging attachment and identification
  between human players and virtual characters while challenging the traditional linear
  structure of storytelling in games and rejecting an eugenic, hierarchical understanding
  of life.
