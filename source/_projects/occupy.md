abstract: 'On the 10th anniversary of the movement, No Turning Back: Ten Years After
  Occupy brings together materials from across the Tamiment Library and Robert F.
  Wagner Labor Archives to examine that first, critical year of Occupy Wall Street.
  It includes archival materials that not only capture much of the movement’s tactics,
  strategies, aesthetics, and language, but also attempt to show how Occupy’s protests
  became a national phenomenon and were a turning point for left movements globally.
  The exhibit is organized around the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City,
  a collectively authored letter to the world, drafted by the Call to Action Working
  Group and ratified by NYCGA, stating why Occupy protestors were reclaiming public
  space in the name of the 99%. It was curated by Shannon O''Neill, Curator for Tamiment-Wagner
  Collections, and Michael Koncewicz, Michael Nash Archivist & Ewen Center Program
  Coordinator and built by Marii Nyrop, Digital Scholarship Services. Additonal credits
  can be found on the site.'

  Downtown, revolutionaries poured
  Through Zucotti, and archivists stored
  Their papers. Now this Wax site's
  All there is (no wealth tax, right?)
  Because Occupy's got Thermidor'ed.
