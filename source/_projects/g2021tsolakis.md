abstract: 'This project asks how, when, and why people in the ancient world were referring
  to their ancestral past. To do so, NYU DH Graduate Fellow Tsolakis built an RDF
  database and wrote programs to query existing databases based on large sets of epigraphic
  evidence and prosopographical information from printed prosopographies and online
  databases. The combined data sets enabled more specific lines of inquiry. For example:
  Why do some families connect their public presence with specific honorific epithets?
  How can name-patterns help us recognize members of the same family? What was the
  role of women in the public sphere and how it was revealed by means of endowments,
  benefactions, or priesthoods?'
