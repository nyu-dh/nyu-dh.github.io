abstract: 'This project maps and visualizes the layered histories of media infrastructure
  development in Glacier National Park, supporting research for my dissertation: “Height
  of Land: Mediating Topography in the Mountain West.” The project has three phases:
  first, drawing on historic maps, photographs, and documents compiled during a year
  of archival research in Montana, I will produce a georeferenced dataset logging
  the construction (and removal) of trails and roads, telegraph and telephone lines,
  and fire, radio, and cell towers within the park. Second, I will produce an online
  interactive map, visualizing the historic ebb and flow of communicative possibility
  within the park. Third, I will perform topographic viewshed analyses on a select
  number of locations in GIS software, opening the door to simulate and speculate
  upon how an infrastructure’s absence or presence within a view—the primary visual
  currency in national parks—transforms a landscape’s aesthetic value. This project
  builds directly upon my dissertation, triangulating between infrastructure, topography,
  and visual economies within western National Parks. In developing an accessible
  interactive map, it advances public-facing scholarship about human and technological
  history in National Parks and other protected natural areas. Finally, it demonstrates
  the potential value of computational viewshed analysis as a method in the digital
  humanities.'
