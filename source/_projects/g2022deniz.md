abstract: 'My proposed project aims to visualize the mobility of the prominent Sufi
  figures in the early modern Ottoman Empire by generating maps with the help of digital
  tools like GIS. This project is threefold: the first aim is to create a data set
  involving prominent Sufi figures in the Ottoman Empire between the sixteenth and
  eighteenth centuries. Investigating both primary and secondary sources, such as
  travelogues, hagiographies, dissertations, and articles; I plan to create a comprehensive
  data set to determine the itinerancies of the Sufi figures by generating metadata
  (name, date of death, affiliated Sufi order, traveled cities, the purpose for travel,
  duration of stay). The second step is the visualization of the data set by creating
  numerous sequential maps via GIS that will indicate the itinerancies of these Sufi
  figures. The last step is to analyze these maps to illuminate the urban aspect of
  Sufism as well as the religious functions of urban centers. A thorough visualization
  of the Sufi itinerancies with this project can yield interesting results and raise
  questions to delve more into the social, intellectual, and power dynamics of this
  era. However, to be able to raise these questions, I will start with the first step:
  the urban centers where all these interactions were happening. Thus, this project
  will serve as a basis for further research on the Sufis and their relationship to
  the urban fabric and thus, the religious and urban history of the Ottoman Empire.'
