abstract: 'Recent advances in building high-quality textual corpora and the application
  of computational methods of analysis such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) have
  allowed Humanities scholars to pose new and fundamental questions in their respective
  fields. However, a lack of technical capacity in these areas is still a hurdle for
  many researchers, especially those working with under-resourced languages like Arabic.
  We address these issues by prototyping the MUTUN platform for streamlining Arabic-language
  corpus development and analysis for non-technical researchers in the Humanities.
  Specifically, the proposed corpus management tool will enable users to: (1) create
  a corpus by importing texts from existing corpora or adding their own digitized
  texts; (2) utilize a variety of organizational features for textual metadata, biobibliographical
  functions, and advanced corpus search capabilities; and (3) automatically annotate
  and analyze their corpus using the suite of NLP tools for Arabic-script texts developed
  by the CAMeL Lab team (NYU Abu Dhabi). Implementing new Digital Humanities tools
  in concert with the corpus building capabilities of MUTUN will empower non-technical
  researchers by providing an accessible digital toolbox for Arabic texts. Going forward,
  we will seek additional funding from national and international granting agencies
  in order to build out the platform for wider adoption.'
