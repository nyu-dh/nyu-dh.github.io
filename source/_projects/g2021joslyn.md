abstract: Joslynâ€™s project sought to complete work on two essential elements of my
  ongoing project of developing an online, open-source, open-access library collecting
  the documents produced by mutual aid organizers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
  fellowship helped Joslyn facilitate the development of anti-oppressive metadata
  meant to work for both scholars and activists. He also planned the development of
  and creation of an exhibition in September 2021 of a series of oral histories collected
  by Bronx Community College students of Bronx-based mutual aid organizers, in collaboration
  with a variety of community-based libraries and archives across New York City.
