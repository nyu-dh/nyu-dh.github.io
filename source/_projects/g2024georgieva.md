abstract: 'The goal of this project is to study amateur singing and voice narration,
  aiming to investigate how more skilled singers and voice narrators perform differently
  from their less skilled counterparts, and to explore the expressive distinctions
  between narrated and sung vocal performances. In order to answer these questions,
  this summer I will collect subjective data from online listeners, who will evaluate
  recordings of singers and audiobook narrators. I will then use linear mixed models
  in RStudio to quantify how perceived performer skill correlates with seven other
  vocal performance features: likeability, enthusiasm, authenticity/realness, emotional
  expression, vocal strength/intensity, intelligibility, and tone color. The singing
  voice recordings will be sourced from the DAMP (Digital Archive of Mobile Performances)
  karaoke dataset, and the narration recordings will be drawn from the LibriSpeech
  audiobook narration dataset. An equal number of recordings will be dedicated to
  singing and narration. This work will be a chapter of my doctoral dissertation on
  digital analyses of singing voice and speech, exploring the intersection of music,
  speech, and sound recording. This project will advance the field of musicology by
  demonstrating the potential for computational methods in the field, and bring music
  and audio analysis into digital humanities scholarship.'
