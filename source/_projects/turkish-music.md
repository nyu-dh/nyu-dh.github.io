abstract: This project involves digitizing audio cassette recordings gathered by retired
  NYU Abu Dhabi Professor Walter Feldman during research for his book, Music of the
  Ottoman Court (1996, repr. 2024). Dr. Feldman is the leading authority on Turkish
  classical music, and his book is the standard work on the subject. Dr. Feldman’s
  recordings include never-before-heard audio materials—lessons, private concerts,
  and public performances— featuring prominent Turkish classical musicians Necdet
  Yasar, Niyazi Sayin, Ihsan Özgen, and others. Digitizing this collection is crucial
  for preservation of this music and to make it accessible to a wider audience. This
  project emphasizes the intercultural connections between Greeks, Turks, Armenians,
  Romanians, Hungarians, Arabs, and Sephardic Jews within the Ottoman Empire. The
  project will transfer these recordings to a digital format and exhibit them on a
  publicly accessible website, accompanied by detailed cataloging and metadata creation
  to facilitate research and exploration. By making these recordings available, this
  initiative not only preserves a crucial part of musical history but also celebrates
  the complex tapestry of relationships that characterizes the music of the Ottoman
  court and its enduring legacy in shaping the cultural identities of the region.
