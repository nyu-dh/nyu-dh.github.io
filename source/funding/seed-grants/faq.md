## Eligibility FAQ

**Q: Who is eligible to apply? Can visiting professors or clinical faculty apply?**
  > Proposals must include at least one full-time NYU faculty member working in the humanities. This would include visiting professors and clinical faculty. Beyond that, there are no restrictions on school, department, or rank, but proposals from faculty in interdisciplinary departments may wish to identify how their research identifies with the humanities.

**Q: Can a graduate student apply?**
  > For larger projects that involve faculty, students can apply as principle investigators, but in general we encourage students to apply for the [Graduate Student Fellowships](/funding/grad-fellowships).

**Q: Are the Digital Humanities Seed Grants open to applications from NYU global network locations?**
  > Yes, the program is open to faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, and all global network campuses.

**Q: Do I have to be in the Humanities to apply for a DH Seed Grant?**
  > Faculty in interdisciplinary departments may apply, and we encourage them to identify how their overall research identifies with the humanities, in addition to the intellectual justification of the particular project and its significance to humanities research.

**Q: At what stage of my project should I apply?**
  > The Digital Humanities Seed Grants are intended to provide start-up funding for projects in their initial stages. While projects that have already received external funding are likely beyond the initial stages and would not be appropriate for a Seed Grant, projects that have received internal funding may be eligible if they are still in a preliminary phase.

## Applications FAQ

**Q: Can I talk to someone about my application in advance?**
  > Questions about project viability and scoping can be directed to [dh.help@nyu.edu](mailto:dh.help@nyu.edu).

**Q: How long should the application be?**
  > Proposals should not exceed three pages, plus a single-page budget summary, and any necessary letters of commitment.

**Q: What does the application need to include?**
  > - Abstract (200 words, which may be used in publicity materials)
  > - Research agenda
  > - Environmental scan
  > - Work plan
  > - Human subjects plan if the work would require IRB approval (note that most humanities research will not)
  > - List of participants
  > - Sustainability plan
  > - Future agenda
  > - Single page budget
  > - Letters of commitment

**Q: What should my work plan include?**
  > A timeline of the agenda to be pursued, including key dates and milestones. Preference is given to projects that scope the work to the time available.

**Q: What is a sustainability plan?**
  > You should explain how digital assets created by this project will be managed and preserved. For a sense of full sustainability plans, see statements from [NEH](https://www.neh.gov/) and [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/). Applicants are encouraged to consult with [Digital Scholarship Services](https://library.nyu.edu/departments/digital-scholarship-services/) about the feasibility of their plans and to understand how their projects can leverage existing NYU services and infrastructure. A preference will be given to projects that make any resources (scholarship, code, or data) openly available unless they give a justification here of the ways such openness would be detrimental to individuals or communities.

## Budget FAQ

**Q: Can I see a sample/model budget?**
  > We recommend that you model your budget on the grants that you aim to apply to. For instance, you could check out the [budget recommendations from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/blog/planning-your-dh-institute-outcomes-and-budgets). The National Institute of Health (NIH) also provides resources to [developing your budget](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/format-and-write/develop-your-budget.htm). We also encourage you to check out NYU's [Office of Sponsored Programs tools for proposal development](https://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/sponsored-programs/proposal-development.html) or contact [dh.help@nyu.edu](mailto:dh.help@nyu.edu) with specific questions.

**Q: How much money can I ask for?**
  > Grants may range in size between $5,000 and $20,000. Collaborative projects are encouraged, but must include at least one NYU faculty member in the humanities. Final awards may be altered at the recommendation of the evaluation committee.

**Q: What sort of expenses are allowed?**
  > Permissible expenses include student stipends, course buy-outs, partial summer salary, and technical resources such as specific equipment, server time, or hosting. Questions regarding specific expenses can be sent to [dh.help@nyu.edu](mailto:dh.help@nyu.edu).

**Q: How do I hire a student?**
  > Check with the NYU resources for [hiring student workers](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/career-development-and-jobs/employers/hiring-student-employees.html). For many departments, NYU facilitates student hiring with the [Handshake](https://nyu.joinhandshake.com/login) web application. If your department does not have its own Handshake account, ask your department administrator about best practices.

**Q: How much do I need to budget for a student worker?**
  > For NYU graduate student workers, you must include an additional 30% for overhead (health insurance, etc). For example, if you have a student working 10 hours at $30/hour, you'd put down $390 ($300 in wages + $90 in overhead). For both undergraduate and graduate student workers, you must ensure that your hourly rate meets the [university's minimum wage rates](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/career-development-and-jobs/employers/hiring-student-employees.html).

**Q: How do I hire an outside worker?**
  > Hiring a consultant or specialist outside of NYU is different from department to department. In some cases, you need to go to your department Human Resources. There may be additional requirements to go through paperwork to hire contractors or vendors. If you know you will be looking to hire someone specific, we encourage you to speak with your department when you create your budget.

**Q: Will funded projects have access to NYU's technologies, software copyrights, and receive technological assistance? Should the budget include the purchase of all of the aforementioned items?**
  > This program is eager to fund projects that expand the use of various services provided by NYU's technology resources. In many cases outside collaborators working with NYU teams are able to to create, for example, accounts within the NYU high performance computing cluster with cost. Experts from NYU Libraries and from NYU Research and Instructional Technology are made available for consultation, but programs needing software developers must budget for them.

**Q: Are there things I cannot purchase with Seed Grant funding?**
  > Personal computer purchases are not permitted. All expenditure must be in compliance with University, School or Department fiscal regulations, whichever is most stringent.

## Expectations FAQ

**Q: Are there responsibilities after the grant period ends?**
  > Grantees are required to give two short presentations, either as part of a panel at the Center for the Humanities or in some other agreed-upon setting. One of the presentations will be a five-minute talk at the fall Digital Humanities Showcase. Grantees will also provide a brief white paper outlining the project’s successes, failures, and future potential.
  >
  > Additionally, grantees who receive funding may be called upon to serve on the review panel the following year.

**Q: What sort of next steps do you expect for grantees?**
  > The future agenda section in your application should describe the goals for this project beyond the granting period and how the project results will be sustained. This may include relevant granting programs for a larger version of the project, a description of the impact, or future use of resources created in the grant period. Projects will be given preference that hold promise to expand NYU’s institutional capacity to support and create high-quality digital humanities research.
