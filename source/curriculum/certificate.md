The [Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://as.nyu.edu/dhss/advanced-certificate.html) trains
students in the creative and critical work of productively bringing digital methods to issues in the humanities fields.
Students learn the fundamentals of programming,
of analyzing and structuring data, and of publishing on the modern web by cultivating their digital skills and engaging
with research that has successfully bridged digital methods and humanistic questions. Students learn to advance academic
knowledge in their own disciplines and to build transferrable skills for carrying that knowledge into their future careers.

Students who wish to complete the degree on its own can
[apply through NYU Slate](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions/humanities.html).
Students currently
enrolled in [one of the joint degree programs](/curriculum/certificate/joint-degrees) should
[apply through the form on this site](https://forms.gle/gtwiFxP67e4c6nU16).

See the [digital humanities courses](/curriculum/courses/) page for a list of courses by semester.
If you have questions about which courses qualify as electives in the certificate program, email the program at [dhss@nyu.edu](mailto:dhss@nyu.edu).

Most certificate program students are enrolled through joint degrees with GSAS doctoral and masterâ€™s programs. Courses are open to all graduate students at NYU; PhD students from other institutions in the New York Area may also enroll.

There are also ways to learn Digital Humanities without formally enrolling in coursework.
The [NYU Library offers workshops](https://nyu.libcal.com/) led by Data Services, Digital Scholarship Services, and High Performance Computing.
