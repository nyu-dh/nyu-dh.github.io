  time: 2:00-5:00 pm
  description: Two of the most important aspects of digital media are their capacity
    to allow for the organization of and creation of connections between data. Collecting
    and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information
    management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday
    experience in the digital age. Because these systems play such a significant role
    in how we communicate with one another they are critical to understanding how
    new media can play a role in public discourse and scholarly conversations. This
    course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the
    digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka,
    Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our
    world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these
    networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell
    more compelling stories. Along with practical work with digital tools, this course
    will include readings on network culture and digital curation by authors such
    as McLuhan, Gitelman, Castells, Shirky, Manovich, Cohen, Ramsay, and Galloway.

  description: 'Data analysis in the humanities presents challenges of scale, interpretation,
    and communication distinct from the social sciences and sciences. In recent years,
    a number of new practices in this sphere have begun to cohere: “cultural analytics,”
    “distant reading,” “macroanalysis,” and “data feminism.” But it can be hard for
    humanists to learn how to apply these practices, not just talk intelligently about
    them. This graduate seminar will develop skills to read and create scholarship
    in these computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. We’ll do so through
    more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will
    teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that
    are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the
    data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not
    necessarily trained or interested in statistics.'

  semester: Spring 2022
  program: XE
  faculty: Kimon Keramidas
  description: This course will consider how the analysis and visualization of information
    through digital technologies has significantly changed the way we look at our
    world both within the academic community and in society at large. The data portion
    of the class will begin with an understanding of the ontologies of data and metadata
    and address analysis techniques such as distant reading, topic modeling, text
    encoding, and text analysis. The visualization portion of the class will interrogate
    just what it means to visualize an argument and will include both a critique of
    and experimentation with timelines, maps, infographics, charts, and visual confections
    that are used as alternatives to textual explanation. We will work with digital
    tools for analyzing and visualizing humanities data, such as AbbyFine, Voyant,
    Topic Modeling Tool, ArcGIS, and Agisoft Metashape.

    to the Study of Moving Images'
  semester: Fall 2022
  program: Cinema Studies
  faculty: Marina Hassapopoulou
  day: Tuesday
  time: 12:30-4:30pm
  description: This course will explore Cinema Studies within the interdisciplinary
    context of the Digital Humanities (DH). Digital tools and platforms, along with
    the databases they create, have expanded the ways we study moving images and filmmaking
    traditions. Despite Cinema Studies’ important contributions to the expansion of
    DH, the study of moving images and time-based media is usually not at the forefront
    of DH-related inquiry. One of the course objectives is to therefore place Cinema
    Studies research at the center of DH methodologies in order to diversify interdisciplinary
    approaches to both DH and Cinema Studies. In this course, students will study
    DH practice alongside related theoretical frameworks in order to explore the profound
    historiographical, philosophical, sociocultural, and institutional imperatives
    that drive the need for digital tools and computational methods in the study of
    moving images. This approach will help students establish in-depth connections
    between theory and practice, and will assist them in planning, prototyping, and
    creating their own final projects to address significant research questions related
    to Cinema Studies and other fields.

  title: Graph Databases, Network Analysis (Special Topics in Digital Humanities for
    the Ancient World)
  semester: Spring 2023
  program: ISAW
  faculty: Sebastian Heath
  day: Monday
  time: 2:00-5:00pm
  description: 'This course will explore the relationship between two overlapping
    approaches to working with data: Graph Databases and Network Analysis. Students
    will learn to apply these approaches to their own work within the broad scope
    of the Ancient World. A “Graph Database” is a collection of heterogeneous entities
    and the relationships between them. The software tools that allow querying of
    these collections start from the perspective of the individual entities and allow
    these entities to be selected, grouped, and counted. For the purposes of this
    course, a “Network” is a collection of nodes and the edges that connect them to
    other nodes in the same set. A focus of the tools for working with networks is
    the whole collection. Which nodes are highly connected? What is the nature of
    the paths that exist between all the nodes? What subgroups exist within a network
    and which nodes mediate between those subgroups? It is the case that ‘nodes’ are
    analogous to ‘entities’ and that ‘edges’ are analogous to ‘relationships’. Starting
    with working examples, the course will explore these similarities as students
    learn how to implement these concepts within the context of their own work. How
    do these generic terms, methods, and questions relate to the past phenomena we
    study? Existing resources, including the Wikidata graph database and the networks
    that can be derived from it, will introduce students to specific tools such as
    the SPARQL query language and the Python programming-language libraries for working
    with networks. Visualization of results will be one focus of our work. While there
    is no prior technical expertise required, an openness and commitment to learning
    digital methods is essential. As the course progresses, students will increasingly
    work with their own data and this will lead to the development and implementation
    of a final project that uses the methods we learn in class. Weekly readings will
    explore working examples of both technologies and explore the impact they are
    having on scholarship and research in the Ancient World. The course may be particularly
    useful to archaeologists, historians, art historians, and philologists who want
    to explore how Graph Databases and Network Analysis can contribute to their own
    research.'

  semester: Spring 2023
  program: Environmental Education
  faculty: Raul Lejano and Carlos Restrepo
  day: Tuesday
  time: 5:00-6:30 pm
  description: This spring, the NYU Environmental Education program is offering a
    class on Environmental Justice and GIS. Digital mapping is a way of representing
    claims we make about justice and the use of space, whether this be the phenomenon
    of food deserts, resilience of coastal communities, sustainability of urban ecological
    habitat, or exposure of children to air toxics. Students are not required to have
    any knowledge of GIS entering the class. In class, four sessions at the computer
    lab will be used to build a working knowledge of GIS, so that students will be
    able to design and create maps using ArcGIS. These lab sessions require in-person
    attendance and, so, there is no zoom option for this class. The meetings will
    require, in total, eight in-class meetings (including the labs), and six or so
    online meetings.

  faculty: Patrick Burns
  day: Monday
  time: 2:00-5:20pm
  description: This course introduces students to computational research methods helpful
    for producing data-driven scholarship involving large collections of historical-language
    text. Drawing on relevant topics in exploratory data science, corpus linguistics,
    and natural language processing, the course provides a forum for students to develop
    hands-on skills in computer programming (using Python), focused primarily on managing
    textual data, string manipulation, text mining and analysis, language modeling,
    and data visualization. Special attention will be given to the use of word embeddings
    and transformer models and their applicability to historical-language text collections.
    Demonstrations throughout the course will draw primarily on English-language examples,
    but because of the philological range and diversity at ISAW, students are encouraged
    to work with digitized text collections in the languages most relevant to their
    research. There are no prerequisites, though students are expected to be open
    to reading, writing, and editing computer programs; students are required to bring
    notebook computers to class. Note that historical-language text for the purpose
    of this course covers texts or collections of texts written before the Early Modern
    period. Permission of the instructor is required.

  program: ISAW
  faculty: Sebastian Heath, Tom Elliott, and David Ratzan
  day: Thursday
  time: 2:00-5:20pm
  description: This course will introduce students to the use of digital tools and
    computational methods in the study of the ancient world. There are no technical
    prerequisites and the course will be of particular interest to early-stage graduate
    students who want a broad introduction that involves hands-on work. The course
    will progress through topics and methods such as applying structure to text via
    XML-based markup languages, introduction to the programmatic manipulation of textual
    data, and how scholarly resources are shared on the public internet and edited
    in collaborative environments. There will also be a focus on structured datasets.
    Students will gain practical experience in acquiring, creating, querying, and
    displaying spatial data, digital images, and 3D models. The course also addresses
    the growing role of so-called "generative AI" and related tools. There will be
    frequent introductions to existing digitally-informed work in disciplines that
    are part of the study of the ancient world, such as textual studies, history,
    and archaeology, as well as more specific fields such as epigraphy, papyrology,
    and numismatics for which exemplary digital projects exist. Readings will introduce
    students to current trends, theories, and ethics in Digital Humanities and will
    encourage discussion of the impact that digital methods and open-licensed content
    are having on research, teaching, and public engagement with scholarly practice.
    Over the course of the semester students will design and then implement a final
    project that can overlap with their existing research interests. It is a requirement
    that students bring their own notebook computers to class. Permission of the instructors
    is required.

    exploitation. As such, the ability to understand and work with data is indispensable
    both for those who want to uncover truth, and those who want to hold power to
    account. This intensive course serves as an introduction to essential computational
    tools and techniques for working with data. The course is designed for artists,
    designers, and researchers in the humanities who have no previous programming
    experience. Covered topics include: the Python programming language, Jupyter Notebook,
    data formats, regular expressions, Pandas, web scraping, relational database concepts,
    simple data visualization and data-driven text generation. Weekly technical tutorials
    and short readings culminate in a self-directed final project.'
