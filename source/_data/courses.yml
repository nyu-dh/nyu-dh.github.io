  day: Tuesday
  time: 2:00-5:00 pm
  description: Two of the most important aspects of digital media are their capacity
    to allow for the organization of and creation of connections between data. Collecting
    and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information
    management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday
    experience in the digital age. Because these systems play such a significant role
    in how we communicate with one another they are critical to understanding how
    new media can play a role in public discourse and scholarly conversations. This
    course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the
    digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka,
    Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our
    world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these
    networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell
    more compelling stories. Along with practical work with digital tools, this course
    will include readings on network culture and digital curation by authors such
    as McLuhan, Gitelman, Castells, Shirky, Manovich, Cohen, Ramsay, and Galloway.

  faculty: Ben Schmidt
  day: Monday
  time: 6:20-9:20 pm
  description: 'Data analysis in the humanities presents challenges of scale, interpretation,
    and communication distinct from the social sciences and sciences. In recent years,
    a number of new practices in this sphere have begun to cohere: “cultural analytics,”
    “distant reading,” “macroanalysis,” and “data feminism.” But it can be hard for
    humanists to learn how to apply these practices, not just talk intelligently about
    them. This graduate seminar will develop skills to read and create scholarship
    in these computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. We’ll do so through
    more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will
    teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that
    are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the
    data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not
    necessarily trained or interested in statistics.'

  title: 'Digital Humanities: Analysis and Visualization'
  semester: Spring 2022
  program: XE
  faculty: Kimon Keramidas
  description: This course will consider how the analysis and visualization of information
    through digital technologies has significantly changed the way we look at our
    world both within the academic community and in society at large. The data portion
    of the class will begin with an understanding of the ontologies of data and metadata
    and address analysis techniques such as distant reading, topic modeling, text
    encoding, and text analysis. The visualization portion of the class will interrogate
    just what it means to visualize an argument and will include both a critique of
    and experimentation with timelines, maps, infographics, charts, and visual confections
    that are used as alternatives to textual explanation. We will work with digital
    tools for analyzing and visualizing humanities data, such as AbbyFine, Voyant,
    Topic Modeling Tool, ArcGIS, and Agisoft Metashape.

  day: Tuesday
  time: 6:20-9:20 pm
  description: This course provides a project-based approach to web programming and
    development. Students will study the principles of web design and each student
    will build two distinct websites based on topics relevant to their interests.
    To complement these practical skills, we will look at how the web has expanded
    our notions of discourse and explore how websites can be used for scholarly communication.
    A deeper understanding of these topics will help you make better decisions not
    only in your own web development practice but also in sharing your work more effectively.

  title: 'Cinema and the Digital Humanities: History, Concepts and New Approaches
    to the Study of Moving Images'
  semester: Fall 2022
  program: Cinema Studies
  faculty: Marina Hassapopoulou
  day: Tuesday
  time: 12:30-4:30pm
  description: This course will explore Cinema Studies within the interdisciplinary
    context of the Digital Humanities (DH). Digital tools and platforms, along with
    the databases they create, have expanded the ways we study moving images and filmmaking
    traditions. Despite Cinema Studies’ important contributions to the expansion of
    DH, the study of moving images and time-based media is usually not at the forefront
    of DH-related inquiry. One of the course objectives is to therefore place Cinema
    Studies research at the center of DH methodologies in order to diversify interdisciplinary
    approaches to both DH and Cinema Studies. In this course, students will study
    DH practice alongside related theoretical frameworks in order to explore the profound
    historiographical, philosophical, sociocultural, and institutional imperatives
    that drive the need for digital tools and computational methods in the study of
    moving images. This approach will help students establish in-depth connections
    between theory and practice, and will assist them in planning, prototyping, and
    creating their own final projects to address significant research questions related
    to Cinema Studies and other fields.

  title: Graph Databases, Network Analysis (Special Topics in Digital Humanities for
    the Ancient World)
  semester: Spring 2023
  program: ISAW
  faculty: Sebastian Heath
  day: Monday
  time: 2:00-5:00pm
  description: 'This course will explore the relationship between two overlapping
    approaches to working with data: Graph Databases and Network Analysis. Students
    will learn to apply these approaches to their own work within the broad scope
    of the Ancient World. A “Graph Database” is a collection of heterogeneous entities
    and the relationships between them. The software tools that allow querying of
    these collections start from the perspective of the individual entities and allow
    these entities to be selected, grouped, and counted. For the purposes of this
    course, a “Network” is a collection of nodes and the edges that connect them to
    other nodes in the same set. A focus of the tools for working with networks is
    the whole collection. Which nodes are highly connected? What is the nature of
    the paths that exist between all the nodes? What subgroups exist within a network
    and which nodes mediate between those subgroups? It is the case that ‘nodes’ are
    analogous to ‘entities’ and that ‘edges’ are analogous to ‘relationships’. Starting
    with working examples, the course will explore these similarities as students
    learn how to implement these concepts within the context of their own work. How
    do these generic terms, methods, and questions relate to the past phenomena we
    study? Existing resources, including the Wikidata graph database and the networks
    that can be derived from it, will introduce students to specific tools such as
    the SPARQL query language and the Python programming-language libraries for working
    with networks. Visualization of results will be one focus of our work. While there
    is no prior technical expertise required, an openness and commitment to learning
    digital methods is essential. As the course progresses, students will increasingly
    work with their own data and this will lead to the development and implementation
    of a final project that uses the methods we learn in class. Weekly readings will
    explore working examples of both technologies and explore the impact they are
    having on scholarship and research in the Ancient World. The course may be particularly
    useful to archaeologists, historians, art historians, and philologists who want
    to explore how Graph Databases and Network Analysis can contribute to their own
    research.'

  title: Environmental Justice through Digital Empowerment
  semester: Spring 2023
  program: Environmental Education
  faculty: Raul Lejano and Carlos Restrepo
  day: Tuesday
  time: 5:00-6:30 pm
  description: This spring, the NYU Environmental Education program is offering a
    class on Environmental Justice and GIS. Digital mapping is a way of representing
    claims we make about justice and the use of space, whether this be the phenomenon
    of food deserts, resilience of coastal communities, sustainability of urban ecological
    habitat, or exposure of children to air toxics. Students are not required to have
    any knowledge of GIS entering the class. In class, four sessions at the computer
    lab will be used to build a working knowledge of GIS, so that students will be
    able to design and create maps using ArcGIS. These lab sessions require in-person
    attendance and, so, there is no zoom option for this class. The meetings will
    require, in total, eight in-class meetings (including the labs), and six or so
    online meetings.
