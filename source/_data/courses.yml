  description: Two of the most important aspects of digital media are their capacity
    to allow for the organization of and creation of connections between data. Collecting
    and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information
    management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday
    experience in the digital age. Because these systems play such a significant role
    in how we communicate with one another they are critical to understanding how
    new media can play a role in public discourse and scholarly conversations. This
    course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the
    digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka,
    Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our
    world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these
    networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell
    more compelling stories. Along with practical work with digital tools, this course
    will include readings on network culture and digital curation by authors such
    as McLuhan, Gitelman, Castells, Shirky, Manovich, Cohen, Ramsay, and Galloway.

  day: Monday
  time: 6:20-9:20 pm
  description: 'Data analysis in the humanities presents challenges of scale, interpretation,
    and communication distinct from the social sciences and sciences. In recent years,
    a number of new practices in this sphere have begun to cohere: “cultural analytics,”
    “distant reading,” “macroanalysis,” and “data feminism.” But it can be hard for
    humanists to learn how to apply these practices, not just talk intelligently about
    them. This graduate seminar will develop skills to read and create scholarship
    in these computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. We’ll do so through
    more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will
    teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that
    are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the
    data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not
    necessarily trained or interested in statistics.'

  title: 'Digital Humanities: Analysis and Visualization'
  semester: Spring 2022
  program: XE
  faculty: Kimon Keramidas
  description: This course will consider how the analysis and visualization of information
    through digital technologies has significantly changed the way we look at our
    world both within the academic community and in society at large. The data portion
    of the class will begin with an understanding of the ontologies of data and metadata
    and address analysis techniques such as distant reading, topic modeling, text
    encoding, and text analysis. The visualization portion of the class will interrogate
    just what it means to visualize an argument and will include both a critique of
    and experimentation with timelines, maps, infographics, charts, and visual confections
    that are used as alternatives to textual explanation. We will work with digital
    tools for analyzing and visualizing humanities data, such as AbbyFine, Voyant,
    Topic Modeling Tool, ArcGIS, and Agisoft Metashape.

  day: Tuesday
  time: 6:20-9:20 pm
  description: This course provides a project-based approach to web programming and
    development. Students will study the principles of web design and each student
    will build two distinct websites based on topics relevant to their interests.
    To complement these practical skills, we will look at how the web has expanded
    our notions of discourse and explore how websites can be used for scholarly communication.
    A deeper understanding of these topics will help you make better decisions not
    only in your own web development practice but also in sharing your work more effectively.

  title: Citizenship in the Digital Age
  semester: Fall 2022
  program: XE
  faculty: Kimon Keramidas
  day: Tuesday
  time: 6:15-9:00pm
  description: Data-driven campaigns, inaccurate polling, hacked email systems, social
    media disinformation, hyper-polarized media coverage, debates over electoral tabulation,
    the evidence is all around us that the digital technologies of the 21st century
    have become central features of global political discourse and processes. This
    course considers how these new technologies have altered our approach to acquiring
    and critiquing data and information, mediated our modes of social communication,
    and in turn, fundamentally changed the experience of being a citizen. The course
    includes discussions of foundational readings on theories of citizenship and the
    development of large-scale networked information systems. Additional topics include
    methods of the role of digital tools and algorithms in shaping polling methodology,
    demographic segmentation through digitally-enhanced mapmaking (see gerrymandering),
    representations of race, gender, and ethnicity in the digital public sphere, and
    online protest and activism. To support readings and in-class discussions, students
    will perform real-time critical analysis through a close integration of the upcoming
    2022 mid-term elections into coursework. Each student will select a significant
    political race to follow and report back to the class about how the history, theories,
    and current events we will be studying relate to the day-to-day progress coming
    out of their race.

  title: 'Space, Place, and Data: Spatial Humanities and the Crafting of Digital Narratives'
  semester: Fall 2022
  program: XE
  faculty: Kimon Keramidas
  day: Wednesday
  time: 2:00-5:00pm
  description: As the digital medium has exploded over the last forty or so years,
    devices, data, networks, and new modes of visual expression have changed our perception
    of and ability to express our sense of where we are and how we perceive landscapes
    of experience. As a result, notions of space and place, and a desire to express
    the situatedness of lived experience and historical narratives, have come increasingly
    to the fore in humanities and the social sciences. At the same time, interdisciplinary
    fields such as geography and digital humanities have looked to provide new lenses
    on the worlds around us (both physical and virtual) and new tools with which to
    share our stories of traveling through different places. These changes reflect
    our increasing capacity to capture and express geographical information through
    new tools for doing work in what has come to be called the “spatial humanities.”
    This course will explore our new perceptions of space and place relative to data
    and data structures both creatively and critically, including questioning how
    the epistemological tendencies of specific tools--and geographic information systems
    (GIS) as a whole--impact our perception of the world. Along with readings and
    discussion, an important part of this course will be learning about the kinds
    of tools that can be used to perform work in the spatial humanities and their
    relative strengths and weaknesses, including Google Maps/Earth, StoryMap JS, Tableau,
    ArcGIS, ESRI StoryMaps and ARIS.
