  abstract: The Brown Brothers Collection is a collaborative, cross-institutional
    research project that will develop robust teaching, research, and public humanities
    resources that leverage the digitized Brown Brothers & Company archives held by
    the New York Public Library. Founded in 1825 by Irish immigrants, this New York
    bank remains in operation as one of the largest private financial services firms
    in the city, Brown Brothers Harriman. An initial phase of collection’s digitization
    was recently completed with support from a Hidden Archives grant. We anticipate
    many kinds of stories that might be told from this collection, ranging from the
    history of global finance capital and the New York banking sector to New York
    City’s financial and administrative role in the slave economy. This pilot seeks
    to create a dataset and machine-readable transcriptions encompassing the contents
    of the original records, and to develop potential uses of the data by scholars,
    teachers, and the general public as an open-access resource.

  cohort_year: '2020'
  abstract: This project will establish a website that showcases the finest writing
    generated by students enrolled in NYU’s Prison Education Project. Unlike many
    websites that publish diaristic writing from the incarcerated, this website focuses
    on displaying students’ abilities as critical and creative thinkers fully capable
    of engaging in rigorous academic and scholarly work. The aim is to provide a wider
    forum for these students’ work and to illustrate the intellectual integrity of
    incarcerated students’ academic potential in ways that are not reflected in the
    existing publishing platforms. By highlighting their ability to see connections
    across disparate texts, to situate their experiences within the context of a broader
    intellectual history, and to use theoretical texts as prisms to deepen and expand
    the meaning and significance of a range of evidence, this project hopes to contribute
    to the reshaping of perceptions and understanding of the incarcerated.

  abstract: This upcoming project received a 2023 Digital Humanities Advancement Grant
    from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The project will create
    a digital prototype that will develop open source machine learning techniques
    for image segmentation and classification to facilitate expanded access to large
    sets of heterogeneous government files. It will develop a robust metadata schema
    for a set of historical migrant records held by the U.S. National Archives (NARA)
    gathered in what are known as A-files (formerly Alien Files). A-files are in essence
    portfolios that are generated by the state for migrants, immigrants, or refugees
    who enter the U.S. and in the process come into contact with border control agencies.
    They contain a wide variety of documentation specific to the individual migrant’s
    life story and migration history. Historical A-files are in the public domain,
    but are currently accessible only by request from NARA, on a file-by-file basis.
    Searchability is limited to a few categories such as country of origin and date
    of birth. M/S will use a corpus of 550 A-files gathered prior to the grant period
    through NARA file requests (which we estimate contain 20,000-25,000 pages of documents
    in total) to model new methods of digital access to large collections of government
    records. Access will be facilitated and expanded through the segmentation of documents,
    identification of document types, and the addition of detailed metadata about
    document types (e.g. government forms, correspondence, employment records, etc.).
    This level of indexing will make the diverse contents of the files discoverable
    by social, political, and geographical criteria. It will enable researchers to
    locate specific topics such as policing and detention, medical care, employment,
    or types and outcomes of legal proceedings. As transnational records, A-files
    will shed new light on immigration history in the U.S., the history of migrants’
    home countries, and the often understudied ways in which the two interconnect.

    and pluralistic storytelling might be applied to colonial botanical collections
    to open up ways to critically interrogate violent systems of classification and
    order. Intersecting the history of science, critical archival studies, and recent
    interventions into decolonizing design, this digital humanities project uses a
    specific set of sources (ranging from archival and manuscript materials to herbarium
    specimens) to ask how women, indigenous experts, and working-class collectors’
    contributions to the history of botany have been subsumed and silenced in the
    service of natural historical “authorship”—in this case, by the British bryologist
    William Mitten (1819-1906). By engaging a multitude of stakeholders across various
    fields and levels of expertise, this public-facing project explores how reading
    moss from multiple perspectives can engender new systems of knowledge production
    crossing colonial natural history, museum and archival studies, and decolonial
    design practices.

  abstract: "“Underwriting Risk in the 18th century” provides the first systematic

    an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the

    first activity involves systematically consulting the remaining records of every
    known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated underwriter in order to ascertain the extant
    information on the insurance of slave voyages through London’s largest insurance
    market. The second activity entails a reevaluation of insurance-focused archival
    collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as
    a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining
    to insurance. The third activity we intend to engage in is preliminary archival
    research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in Spain, Holland,
    and Switzerland as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to
    Europe. The first result of our funded activities will be the foundational research
    that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary value was produced and inscribed
    during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The second result of our funded activities
    will be a vastly expanded data set to include in the digital ledger I founded
    and direct, Treasury of Weary Souls, which currently provides interactive, public

    to fund more intensive policing in the racially segregated and disinvested neighborhoods
    where forfeitures are spatially concentrated. Public officials defend forfeiture
    by claiming that seized assets have the capacity to cause harm. However, through
    ethnographic research on police practices and in forfeiture courtrooms, he found
    that forfeiture operated through a racializing framework of moral remediation
    and punitive dispossession. Based on my extensive archival research, he also found
    that Philadelphia prosecutors forfeited 1,696 homes—many taken from Black and
    Latinx women and auctioned to developers—and earned over $80 million through the
    seizure of cash between the early 1990s and 2018. The Digital Humanities Graduate
    Student Summer Fellowship was used to map incidents of home and cash forfeiture
    in Philadelphia in relation to spatial measures of racial inequality. These GIS
    products aimed to visually convey a central thesis of his dissertation: that police
    manage, maintain, and reproduce racial inequality in the contemporary American
    city. He ultimately argues that forfeiture represents a regulatory state intervention
    into the urban drug economy that reproduces racial segregation and fuels urban
    redevelopment.'

  abstract: "What connects a social media user to the ethnocide of the Uyghur people?
    How do social media comments reflect public response to international crises and
    act as a metric for online activism? Presently, nearly 2-million Uyghurs are detained
    and tortured in reeducation camps in Xinjiang, China. Yet, the crisis lacks representation
    in broadcast media and instead relies on online activism to raise awareness. A
    short, viral comic titled What Has Happened to Me documents Uyghur refugee Mihrigul
    Tursun’s trauma in reeducation camps. In online activism, comments are akin to
    word of mouth. This project seeks to determine how comments reflect public response
    in order to aid activists in gauging reception beyond quantified but indeterminate
    “likes.” \nUsing Intelligent Archive, Microsoft Excel, and Python, Ozkiral answers
    these questions by congregating and analyzing the comic’s comments through word
    frequency analysis and sentiment analysis. Being able to examine the responses
    of an entire comment section, as opposed to cherry-picked examples, reveals the
    general opinion of the audience by quantifying their sentiments and graphing their
    associations and reactions. Thus, his project ascertains whether Instagram and
    Twitter respond similarly to the same comic that is a testament to an international
    crisis, as well as amalgamate the two platforms’ comments to gauge a holistic
    response. In answering the posed questions, his data gauges a congregated sentiment
    of each population that can aid online activists to communicate with their target
    audience. Furthermore, this project contributes to a broader field of activism
    while raising awareness for an international crisis."

    She is interested in understanding how the cultural consumption of India (as manifested

    videos mimicking Bollywood song-and-dance--as source material for this project.

  cohort_year: '2021'
  abstract: 'The publication of Mark Twain’s autobiography 100 years after his death
    presents a difficult proposition for the reading public with an unwieldy size
    of over 2000 pages. The work also presents an opportunity for computational text
    analysis to provide insights where more traditional close readings of it might
    prove difficult. My dissertation, “The Art of Literary Modeling”, demonstrates
    new scholarly activities that provide context sensitive, evidentiary bases for
    making interpretive claims from computational models of literature. Its first
    chapter answers the question, "What does it mean to read literature as data?"
    That chapter''s discussion of "literary" data quality looks to versions of Emily
    Dickinson''s poetry amid her multiple, posthumous publications. It adapts data
    quality metrics from information science to provide an overall assessment of those
    digital versions, and produces a new collection of poems that reflect their data
    quality with respect to her oeuvre. This next chapter will answer the followup
    question: "What does it mean to model literature as data?" Applying standards
    for model selection and quality analysis from statistics known as "information
    criterion" reveals differences between various models of a work. That comparison
    made possible by information criteria presents a new, qualitative decision point
    for the study of literature as data. By looking to passages of Twain’s autobiography
    noted by high quality models of it and then further assessing them with scholarly
    understandings of those passages, it becomes possible to produce new findings
    on the autobiography and sound methodology for model quality generalizable to
    humanities research beyond this project.'

  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: By the late twentieth century, conservation scientists declared that time
    was “running out” for Madagascar as plant species were “disappearing 500 times
    faster than normal.” Plants deemed immortal in Malagasy culture, such as the famous
    Baobab Tree have, for the past few decades, teetered on the edge of extinction.
    Yet the contingencies of climate change have shifted conservation priorities so
    dramatically that, in recent years, botanical evolutionary concepts have been
    applied unequally in light of seemingly more pressing human-centric concerns.
    Without plants, though, humans will go extinct. Focusing on the nineteenth and
    twentieth century plant collections at the Missouri Botanical Garden and New York
    Botanical Garden, this project will (1) create a database of herbarium specimens
    collected in Madagascar, (2) use ArcGis to map the locations of these specimens,
    and (3) map plantations of luxury high-priced botanicals that have driven human-centric
    agriculture (vanilla, clove, and coffee). By incorporating Malagasy worldviews
    about the place of plants in their broader environment into this digital project,
    I question how ecological and evolutionary knowledge has been created and conveyed
    to both local and global conservation groups on an island rife with deforestation,
    political and social conflict—all contributing to its status as one of the top
    ten nations most vulnerable to climate change. Intersecting conservation law,
    critical archival studies, and the history of science, this project uses a variety
    of scientific specimens and data alongside archival material to question the colonial
    legacies of conservation science over Malagasy knowledge.

  abstract: Following the framework of distant reading, this project aims to provide
    a comprehensive analysis of gendered social relationships in American literature
    (1880-2000). While multiple studies in the distant reading paradigm have investigated
    conceptual associations of male and female characters in American fiction, this
    project is, to the best of my knowledge, the first to focus explicitly on how
    gendered characters interact, that is, the concrete narrative actions exchanged
    between characters of different genders. To do this, the project builds on software
    developed by the author that allows for the automatic extraction of semantic motifs
    associated with entities in textual data. Substantively, the project focuses on
    two main research questions. First, it aims to clarify whether relationships have
    become more symmetric over the 20th century in terms of their action content,
    and if so, whether this trend has been a linear one. Second, it aims to conduct
    a fine-grained analysis into the evolution of the semantics of gendered relationships
    by identifying and tracing distinct relationship frames such as friendship, courtship
    and love, or parenting.

  abstract: 'Over the course of this summer, I propose to apply digital humanities
    methods to the text of the American Jewish Year Book (AJYB) to support research
    for my dissertation, “The 1970s’ New Jewish Politics: Grassroots Orthodox Activism
    in the U.S.” Working with PDFs of the AJYB, fully and freely accessible online,
    my proposed summer project will transform the AJYB’s raw text into structured
    data. The project’s first output will include a new dataset of Jewish population
    across the U.S. and Canada for each decade across the 20th century, and a census-oriented
    map of this population. I have already transcribed population counts for the years
    1950, 1960, 1971, 1980, and 1990, creating 3,373 rows of data.  Tasks for this
    component involve transcription, data “cleaning,” and matching Jewish population
    entries with geographic coordinates and with general U.S. population counts for
    the same geographic areas and decades. The project''s second output will be open-ended
    textual analysis, based on digitally parsing approximately 30,550 AJYB pages from
    1948 to 1995, focusing on Jewish Orthodox organizations, personalities, and events.
    The AJYB’s publisher is not aware of any comparable mapping, data visualization
    or textual analysis project based on the AJYB. With the support of the Digital
    Humanities Graduate Student Summer Fellowship, I hope to make the AYJB’s demographic
    information available to scholars and the wider public for the first time as structured
    clean data, and to gain an unprecedented overview of Orthodox activities in the
    late twentieth century.'

  abstract: |-
    British polar exploration in the nineteenth century was a close-knit community, held together by professional endeavor and personal connection. Lasting from 1818 to 1859, this era was characterized by its close association with the Admiralty and the government, the beginnings of the use of steam power and industrial technology in exploration, and the introduction of the concepts of the British-conquered Arctic and Antarctic into the popular imagination, laying the foundation for decades of imperial myth-making and exploratory endeavor to come. 
    Legendary figures such as Sir John Franklin still dominate discussions of this era, but polar exploration was a national pastime, broadly involving people of all classes in its planning, participation, and popular reception, from artists to lords to politicians to outspoken critics. Performing social network analysis on information collected via archival research, I plan to produce a set of interactive data visualizations cataloging the historical participants in Victorian polar exploration, illuminating unexpected correlations, and allowing for easy viewing of the myriad nodes and edges of the wider community. 
    This public humanities project will draw on my scholarly interests in communities of affinity and participatory cultures in order to encourage continued interest in the lesser-studied aspects of polar history. Presenting this information digitally in accessible visual form will, I hope, prompt new inquiries into the lesser-known relationships and figures who make up the underlying layers of the Victorian polar milieu.

  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: 'The digitization of Latin-script languages has fundamentally changed
    the scope of scholarship in the humanities, but only recently have scholars undertaken
    similar projects for Arabic-script texts. The Open Islamicate Texts Initiative
    (OpenITI) represents the most significant effort to date in producing a corpus
    of machine actionable texts written in Arabic, currently containing over 10,000
    works. Despite the size of this project, some bodies of literature are significantly
    unrepresented, chief among them are works on Sufism, usually understood as Islamic
    mysticism. In fact, only 153 of the 10,393 entries in OpenITI are Sufi works,
    despite Sufism’s immense popularity over the last millennium. Given this gap in
    the extant textual corpora, this project will produce the first machine actionable
    corpus of medieval Sufi works, comprised of twenty-four key texts annotated according
    to the field standard mARkdown “tagging” schema. Furthermore, this project will
    put together a suite of Python-based tools to allow for various analyses. These
    tools will focus on four areas: extracting names of individuals for network analysis
    to better understand Sufi social history; examining Qur’ānic references to illuminate
    how Sufis interpreted and understood the word of God; using algorithms to elucidate
    the complex and subtle ways in which authors drew from one another; and exploring
    the changing semantics of key terms and foundational concepts in Sufi thought
    across time. This project will not only shed new light on medieval Sufi history
    but also contribute to efforts already underway to digitize Islamic texts by introducing
    a previously neglected body of literature.'

  abstract: 'This research project stems from provocations by abolitionist organizers
    in New York City, with questions such as, “Why are there no ACS offices in SoHo?”
    For the summer of 2022, I aim to create an interactive, digital map that layers
    three key data sets for visualization: 1) the number of child welfare investigations
    that take place in New York City by neighborhood, 2) the location of Administration
    for Children’s Services (ACS) offices, and 3) the locations of the top New York
    City schools that make reports to the Office of Children and Family Services.
    The overarching research question for this digital mapping project is: what does
    understanding space relationally reveal about surveillance tools and practices
    in family policing? Asking such a question is rooted in the methodologies of Black
    Feminist Geographies. Following Simone Browne’s work regarding surveillance technologies,
    I’d like to understand the spatial relationship between schools, child welfare
    offices, and the space of the home through the home visits caseworkers conduct.
    My intention is this project will inform aspects of my dissertation. As a scholar
    engaged with communities organizing to make changes in how the state interacts
    with families, especially poor Black and Brown families, my intention is not only
    for this digital map to serve an intellectual purpose of answering research questions,
    but for this map to hopefully lead to change in how family policing is understood
    in New York City.'

  abstract: 'Looking at a number of publications from research institutes and publishing

    of Mizrahi texts in the Arab world. In order to attend to the roles of different

    in order to map, catalog, selectively digitize (in accordance with fair use guidelines),
    contextualize, and crucially, relate works published in English, French, Hebrew,
    and Arabic on Mizrahi thought. In the process, it hopes to ask: why and how have
    Arab intellectuals written about the Mizrahi struggle in Israel? Despite their
    purported focus on “the enemy,” many of these works translate and endorse the
    views of Mizrahi social movements; emphasize historic ties of Jewish communities
    with their co-citizens of other faiths in the Arab world; and elevate non-Zionist
    Jewish voices on the Palestinian Question. Indeed, all of the works in question
    argue that the stakes and impact of Mizrahi struggle are relevant, either as a
    part of or an obstacle to, the Palestinian struggle against Zionism. Rather than
    seeing Mizrahim and Palestinians as separate populations brought together only
    through their common position as oppressed, this study hopes to center these actors
    themselves showing how they engaged–even after their separation by partition and
    the hardening of borders–with each other and with broader global and regional
    intellectual currents such as Continental existentialism, Communism, Arab leftism,

    a data set involving prominent Sufi figures in the Ottoman Empire between the
    sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Investigating both primary and secondary sources,
    such as travelogues, hagiographies, dissertations, and articles; I plan to create
    a comprehensive data set to determine the itinerancies of the Sufi figures by
    generating metadata (name, date of death, affiliated Sufi order, traveled cities,
    the purpose for travel, duration of stay). The second step is the visualization
    of the data set by creating numerous sequential maps via GIS that will indicate
    the itinerancies of these Sufi figures. The last step is to analyze these maps
    to illuminate the urban aspect of Sufism as well as the religious functions of
    urban centers. A thorough visualization of the Sufi itinerancies with this project
    can yield interesting results and raise questions to delve more into the social,
    intellectual, and power dynamics of this era. However, to be able to raise these
    questions, I will start with the first step: the urban centers where all these
    interactions were happening. Thus, this project will serve as a basis for further
    research on the Sufis and their relationship to the urban fabric and thus, the
    religious and urban history of the Ottoman Empire.'

    vulnerabilities, but creative initiatives for survival, in these new conditions
    structured by old inequalities. A seed grant will enable us to a) broaden the

  abstract: My doctoral dissertation explores the shortcomings of AI Judges, that

    Due to blackboxing and proprietary rights, it is not possible for a researcher
    to study how AI Judge models and other automated technologies are being built
    by states or private tech companies. To bypass this issue, I started building
    a prototype AI Judge model to have a hands-on approach, allowing for a more immersive
    means to understand the possibilities and limitations of code/coding. My NYU Digital
    Humanities project – "Prototyping as Ethnography" – is a paper that bridges the
    methods of Digital Humanities and Anthropology to conceptualize how ethnography
    can be broadened to include prototyping. The goal of this project was not to create
    the “perfect” AI Judge model, but rather having an immersive and hands-on approach
    to engaging with programming language and learn how code “behaves.” My method
    is connected to anthropologists Rabinow and Bennet’s work on how participant observation
    can include researchers conducting their own experiments in the laboratory. I
    also draw from Galloway’s method of ‘algorithmic reenactment’ which promotes re-enacting
    code from archives and Hartman’s ‘critical fabulation’ which proposes that researchers
    might have to fill in the gaps of archives by imagining what might have happened
    when there is no way to know otherwise. The goal is to map new ways of diversity
    in critical thinking, rupturing methodological and theoretical boundaries to locate
    and analyze findings.

    concerning the mui tsai institution in British Hong Kong and Malaya. The Mui Tsai
    institution placed young girls in what Chinese families viewed as adoption and
    household duties and what European activists viewed as trafficking and slavery.
    International uproar and debate stemmed from this disagreement of definitions
    and appropriate regulatory measures. In this project, I use methods such as topic
    modeling and sentiment analysis to conduct text analysis with R on a random selection
    of this material to shed light on the investigation process. This analysis uncovers
    insights such as biases in interview questioning and how witnesses’ overall sentiments
    towards the mui tsai institution were influenced by their geo-cultural origins
    and experiences. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the
    British Empire during a period of imperial decline: how it navigated intercultural

    construction shifted accordingly. Further, the findings of this project hold great

    and text wrangling, this project creates digital social knowledge that can be
    used to foster greater learning and exploration of the intercultural differences
    that convolute contemporary debates of trafficking, slavery and their regulation.

  abstract: Cartography and geography fulfilled a crucial role in the process of colonization
    of the Western Amazon rainforest. Most of us have seen maps from the region scratched
    with international boundaries dividing the region between Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,
    Peru, and Bolivia minimizing or completely erasing indigenous territories. Nineteenth-century
    maps mostly detail rivers and resource areas that could be exploited; the information
    maps displayed correlated with the advance and desires of colonization and the
    geographies of capitalism. The goal of this project is to begin a historical cartography
    that completely shifts our geographical perception of the Amazon rainforest while
    visualizing the ongoing process of colonization of the region. The Amazon was
    never empty, indigenous territories or even indigenous populations in voluntary
    isolation that still lived today on the Amazon are evidence of the resistance
    to colonization. However, through digital tools and a reorganization of the information
    displayed on maps, it is possible to shift their purpose and visualize the historical
    process of colonization, thereby countering the processes that have attempted
    to make invisible the indigenous history of this region. With the digital humanities
    summer funding, I will finish a small-scale sample database of settlements in
    the Amazon, a database for commercial routes, and a database for indigenous territories.
    The databases will be displayed on six maps one for each decade from 1850 to 1912
    to visualize the transformation and colonization of the indigenous territories
    in the Western Amazon.

  cohort_year: '2023'
  abstract: At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States proclaimed an
    Open Door Policy that sought to protect China’s territorial integrity and governmental
    sovereignty amid fears that inter-imperial scrambles for territory would implode
    global capitalism. Why would the US proclaim an anti-imperial policy at a time
    when its settler colonial empire spread deeper into the Western Hemisphere and
    into the Pacific world? This project proposes that the premise of defending China’s
    territorial sovereignty articulated a new geopolitical strategy that sought progressive
    modernization and developmental aid without “formal” colonization. Amid uneven
    treaties that ceded land to foreign powers and various domestic frontier disputes,
    China’s very territory and government needed to be remade and US corporations
    and policymakers staked a share in this future. Rather than begin with the established
    borders, I digitize the construction of territorial sovereignty of China through
    significant agricultural, exploratory, pedagogical, and journalistic projects
    from the declaration of the Open Door in 1899 to the establishment of a territorially
    bounded communist state in 1949. This project draws upon digital humanities techniques
    to create an interactive map to show that the division of the world into nation-states
    was not merely the work of diplomats and statesmen, but required a variety of
    actors such as explorers, journalists, and researchers. Ultimately, I show how
    territorial sovereignty needed to be built anew through the collaboration between
    a progressive US imperialism and Chinese nationalism as geopolitics is not merely
    diplomatic relations but the political and material creation of new geographies.

    development in Glacier National Park, supporting research for my dissertation:
    “Height of Land: Mediating Topography in the Mountain West.” The project has three
    phases: first, drawing on historic maps, photographs, and documents compiled during
    a year of archival research in Montana, I will produce a georeferenced dataset
    logging the construction (and removal) of trails and roads, telegraph and telephone
    lines, and fire, radio, and cell towers within the park. Second, I will produce
    an online interactive map, visualizing the historic ebb and flow of communicative
    possibility within the park. Third, I will perform topographic viewshed analyses
    on a select number of locations in GIS software, opening the door to simulate
    and speculate upon how an infrastructure’s absence or presence within a view—the
    primary visual currency in national parks—transforms a landscape’s aesthetic value.
    This project builds directly upon my dissertation, triangulating between infrastructure,
    topography, and visual economies within western National Parks. In developing
    an accessible interactive map, it advances public-facing scholarship about human
    and technological history in National Parks and other protected natural areas.
    Finally, it demonstrates the potential value of computational viewshed analysis
    as a method in the digital humanities.'

  abstract: VR Museum Ukraine is a virtual museum project which explores the various
    ways that artists, activists, and institutions have used digital technology to
    preserve Ukrainian culture and document the realities of the ongoing war. The
    museum presents objects such as 3D models of monuments and photographs alongside
    accompanying interviews and information from their creators in a multimedia virtual
    exhibition space where visitors can experience them via a VR headset.

  abstract: "Visioning Provisioning is a project that investigates and creates a visual
    representation of the food provisioning practices of food insecure New Yorkers.
    Food provisioning is defined as the “mental, physical and emotional labor involved
    in providing food for oneself and one’s family.” It is required daily, and made
    more difficult by socioeconomic and geographic constraints (Meierotto and Castellano,
    2020). This project explores the possibility of using maps to visualize the labor
    involved in sourcing food for families living with food insecurity. My prior research
    has shown that food insecure households expend an excess of time and energy each
    week figuring out how to stretch resources, such as limited funds, limited transportation,
    SNAP benefits, and food distribution opportunities. This project is born from
    my experience teaching food systems to undergraduates and seeing how for those
    who have not experienced food insecurity, the labor involved in food provisioning
    is much easier to comprehend when represented geospatially. My ambition for this
    project is to conduct create a resource that opens eyes to the often invisible
    lived experience of individuals navigating New York City’s food systems. With
    qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews, photo logs and food journals,
    I have created maps that chart food provisioning routes of the participants in
    my study. These maps include the costs associated with locations, and visual and
    textual insight about the impact of the process on emotional and physical wellbeing.
    However, in some cases, the map proved to not to be the ideal representation.
    In those instances, I have used timelines and direct quotes to illustrate experience.
    \n\nIt is a failure of our food system that some New Yorkers must spend an undue
    amount of time and energy providing food for their families. I believe representing
    this failure is imperative for fighting narratives about individualized responsibility
    for food insecurity and diet-related diseases. The potential for this project
    extends beyond the classroom, as it could become a tool for food policy analysts
    and advocates. It is my most ambitious hope that creating a resource for students
    and change makers to see this process is a step towards reforming the food system."

  title: Making an Accessible Catalog for the CLACS Quechua Library

  abstract: 'I began creating a Quechua library through NYU’s Center for Latin American
    and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) in Spring 2023. This library includes Quechua language
    learning books, story books, Andean history books, movies, audio files, and archival
    materials that have been a part of CLACS’s collection for many years. However,
    these materials are largely unknown to the community, and aren’t easily accessible.
    This summer, using a database of the materials and CollectionBuilder: an open
    source, Jekyll-based framework for creating digital collections, I created a Runakunaq
    Bibliotecanku (The People''s Library) for easier browsing and searching through
    the collection. The website is up, with many improvements on the way (including
    trilingual browsing and search, more local metadata, and more visualizations of
    the collection). At this time, patrons can browse, search, and request scans of
    any of the print materials we have at the CLACS library.'

  abstract: The Archives of Virtual Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Mexico Nineteenth-century
    Mexico was one of the first and most radical abolitionist nations in the Americas,
    where elites constructed a national identity grounded on racial inclusion and
    antislavery. Nevertheless, throughout this period, various forms of forced labor
    and racial subjugation flourished in Mexico’s borderland regions of Texas, Yucatán,
    and Chiapas. These practices of bondage, indenture, and peonage were legally ambiguous,
    yet practically difficult to distinguish from slavery. While scholars have mentioned
    in passing many of the documents that attested to this traffic, none have given
    an in-depth analysis of the documents that attest to these forms of subjugation.
    Many of these documents are contracts that employers used to maintain a pretense
    of “free labor” relations, including simulating the workers’ consent. This summer
    project has focused on digitizing and transcribing these documents and adding
    metadata using optical character recognition (OCR) software through Transkribus.
    Publicly available AI transcription models on Transkribus were trained on handwritten
    documents date to 15th and 16th-century Spain. I have dedicated most of my time
    to training an AI language model on 19th-century documents in Spanish from archives
    in the Mexico, the U.S., Guatemala, and Spain. I have then used this model to
    then transcribe hundreds of pages of archival documents related to the trafficking
    of laborers across Mexico’s borders and make them fully searchable. This work
    will make these documents more publicly accessible and easy to use for other scholars
    interested in indenture on Mexico’s borderlands.

  title: Excavating the Evolving Self in Autobiographies

  cohort_year: '2023'
  abstract: 'Sociologists have long hypothesized that the nature of the human self
    has evolved over time. From Durkheim to Foucault, social theorists argue that
    sociohistorical shifts ranging from the industrialization to the growth of psychotherapy
    have coincided with changes in the characteristics that distinguish people’s core
    modes of selfhood, rendering people more or less individualistic, calculating,
    expressive, or narcissistic. In this paper, I leverage computational techniques
    to assess whether people’s own self-understandings have evolved over time. Drawing
    on a novel corpus of over 25,000 English-language autobiographies published between
    1770 and 1968, I explore how the ways in which autobiographers characterize themselves
    have evolved between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. To gain insight into
    how the self-characterizations of members of different social groups may have
    converged or diverged over time, I also disaggregate trends in self-representations
    based on the gender, nationality, location of birth, and occupation of autobiographers.
    This research project will provide insight into how autobiographers understand
    and represent themselves in texts, and it will constitute the first computational
    analysis of a large-scale dataset of full-text, English-language autobiographies. '

  abstract: "The Global Image Gallery project began as an affordability and inclusivity
    effort. Faculty sought to replace a costly and Eurocentric art history textbook
    used across the LIberal Studies Program’s required three-semester Arts and Cultures
    sequence with a data set that not only reflected the global focus of the program
    but also gave students and faculty the ability to fashion their own narratives
    and meanings with the images and metadata it contained. The resulting site, the
    Liberal Studies Global Image Gallery, went into use for all first year courses
    in the fall semester of 2019 and now serves all 2500 LS first and second year
    students. In addition to having access to the image gallery itself, students and
    faculty also have access to a copy of the data set itself, allowing them to fashion
    timelines, exhibits, and other digital forms as products of personal or class
    research projects. \n\nThe Global Image Gallery consists of a dataset stored in
    Google Sheets, images (currently stored in Google Drive but slated to move to
    an IIIF server), and a WordPress site into which content is delivered from the
    dataset via a customized CSV uploader. The gallery currently includes 1113 unique
    posts with more added on an ongoing basis."
