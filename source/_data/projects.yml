  abstract: The Brown Brothers Collection is a collaborative, cross-institutional
    research project that will develop robust teaching, research, and public humanities
    resources that leverage the digitized Brown Brothers & Company archives held by
    the New York Public Library. Founded in 1825 by Irish immigrants, this New York
    bank remains in operation as one of the largest private financial services firms
    in the city, Brown Brothers Harriman. An initial phase of collection’s digitization
    was recently completed with support from a Hidden Archives grant. We anticipate
    many kinds of stories that might be told from this collection, ranging from the
    history of global finance capital and the New York banking sector to New York
    City’s financial and administrative role in the slave economy. This pilot seeks
    to create a dataset and machine-readable transcriptions encompassing the contents
    of the original records, and to develop potential uses of the data by scholars,
    teachers, and the general public as an open-access resource.

  cohort_year: '2020'
  abstract: This project will establish a website that showcases the finest writing
    generated by students enrolled in NYU’s Prison Education Project. Unlike many
    websites that publish diaristic writing from the incarcerated, this website focuses
    on displaying students’ abilities as critical and creative thinkers fully capable
    of engaging in rigorous academic and scholarly work. The aim is to provide a wider
    forum for these students’ work and to illustrate the intellectual integrity of
    incarcerated students’ academic potential in ways that are not reflected in the
    existing publishing platforms. By highlighting their ability to see connections
    across disparate texts, to situate their experiences within the context of a broader
    intellectual history, and to use theoretical texts as prisms to deepen and expand
    the meaning and significance of a range of evidence, this project hopes to contribute
    to the reshaping of perceptions and understanding of the incarcerated.

  abstract: "“Underwriting Risk in the 18th century” provides the first systematic

    Africans during the designated period. It will provide foundational research for
    an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the
    trans-Atlantic trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. This
    research is comprised of three activities that will produce two outcomes. The
    first activity involves systematically consulting the remaining records of every
    known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated underwriter in order to ascertain the extant
    information on the insurance of slave voyages through London’s largest insurance
    market. The second activity entails a reevaluation of insurance-focused archival
    collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as
    a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining
    to insurance. The third activity we intend to engage in is preliminary archival
    research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in Spain, Holland,
    and Switzerland as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to
    Europe. The first result of our funded activities will be the foundational research
    that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary value was produced and inscribed
    during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The second result of our funded activities
    will be a vastly expanded data set to include in the digital ledger I founded
    and direct, Treasury of Weary Souls, which currently provides interactive, public
    access to all known insurance policies that underwrote enslaved persons as property
    on the plantations of the antebellum American South."

    specific set of sources (ranging from archival and manuscript materials to herbarium
    specimens) to ask how women, indigenous experts, and working-class collectors’
    contributions to the history of botany have been subsumed and silenced in the
    service of natural historical “authorship”—in this case, by the British bryologist
    William Mitten (1819-1906). By engaging a multitude of stakeholders across various
    fields and levels of expertise, this public-facing project explores how reading
    moss from multiple perspectives can engender new systems of knowledge production
    crossing colonial natural history, museum and archival studies, and decolonial

    primary resource for humanities, social sciences, and other scholars, but due
    to the diverse standards and practices among the libraries, archives, and community
    organizations that collect and maintain them, accessing them through traditional

  cohort_year: '2021'
  abstract: 'Smith''s dissertation explores how police and prosecutors use civil forfeiture
    to wage the drug war in Philadelphia. Forfeiture operates through the legal fiction
    of guilty property, meaning that property can be seized even if its owner is not
    charged with a crime. The practice was adopted by law enforcement officials in
    Philadelphia during the 1980s to seize cash, cars, and homes allegedly implicated
    in criminalized narcotics transactions. The city has used these seized assets
    to fund more intensive policing in the racially segregated and disinvested neighborhoods
    where forfeitures are spatially concentrated. Public officials defend forfeiture
    by claiming that seized assets have the capacity to cause harm. However, through
    ethnographic research on police practices and in forfeiture courtrooms, he found
    that forfeiture operated through a racializing framework of moral remediation
    and punitive dispossession. Based on my extensive archival research, he also found
    that Philadelphia prosecutors forfeited 1,696 homes—many taken from Black and
    Latinx women and auctioned to developers—and earned over $80 million through the
    seizure of cash between the early 1990s and 2018. The Digital Humanities Graduate
    Student Summer Fellowship was used to map incidents of home and cash forfeiture
    in Philadelphia in relation to spatial measures of racial inequality. These GIS
    products aimed to visually convey a central thesis of his dissertation: that police
    manage, maintain, and reproduce racial inequality in the contemporary American
    city. He ultimately argues that forfeiture represents a regulatory state intervention
    into the urban drug economy that reproduces racial segregation and fuels urban
    redevelopment.'

    How do social media comments reflect public response to international crises and
    act as a metric for online activism? Presently, nearly 2-million Uyghurs are detained
    and tortured in reeducation camps in Xinjiang, China. Yet, the crisis lacks representation
    in broadcast media and instead relies on online activism to raise awareness. A
    short, viral comic titled What Has Happened to Me documents Uyghur refugee Mihrigul
    Tursun’s trauma in reeducation camps. In online activism, comments are akin to
    word of mouth. This project seeks to determine how comments reflect public response
    in order to aid activists in gauging reception beyond quantified but indeterminate
    “likes.” \nUsing Intelligent Archive, Microsoft Excel, and Python, Ozkiral answers
    these questions by congregating and analyzing the comic’s comments through word
    frequency analysis and sentiment analysis. Being able to examine the responses
    of an entire comment section, as opposed to cherry-picked examples, reveals the
    general opinion of the audience by quantifying their sentiments and graphing their
    associations and reactions. Thus, his project ascertains whether Instagram and
    Twitter respond similarly to the same comic that is a testament to an international
    crisis, as well as amalgamate the two platforms’ comments to gauge a holistic
    response. In answering the posed questions, his data gauges a congregated sentiment
    of each population that can aid online activists to communicate with their target
    audience. Furthermore, this project contributes to a broader field of activism
    while raising awareness for an international crisis."

  subtitle: Literary Model Quality and the Autiobiography of Mark Twain
  category: Grad Fellowship Project
  tags:
  - text-analysis
  cohort_year: '2021'
  abstract: 'The publication of Mark Twain’s autobiography 100 years after his death
    presents a difficult proposition for the reading public with an unwieldy size
    of over 2000 pages. The work also presents an opportunity for computational text
    analysis to provide insights where more traditional close readings of it might
    prove difficult. My dissertation, “The Art of Literary Modeling”, demonstrates
    new scholarly activities that provide context sensitive, evidentiary bases for
    making interpretive claims from computational models of literature. Its first
    chapter answers the question, "What does it mean to read literature as data?"
    That chapter''s discussion of "literary" data quality looks to versions of Emily
    Dickinson''s poetry amid her multiple, posthumous publications. It adapts data
    quality metrics from information science to provide an overall assessment of those
    digital versions, and produces a new collection of poems that reflect their data
    quality with respect to her oeuvre. This next chapter will answer the followup
    question: "What does it mean to model literature as data?" Applying standards
    for model selection and quality analysis from statistics known as "information
    criterion" reveals differences between various models of a work. That comparison
    made possible by information criteria presents a new, qualitative decision point
    for the study of literature as data. By looking to passages of Twain’s autobiography
    noted by high quality models of it and then further assessing them with scholarly
    understandings of those passages, it becomes possible to produce new findings
    on the autobiography and sound methodology for model quality generalizable to
    humanities research beyond this project.'

  abstract: Following the collapse of the Soviet regime, Russia seemed poised to develop
    a robust public sphere. This unprecedented moment coincided with the global digital
    revolution, in particular the advent of the Internet — a resource whose immediate
    mobilization by wealthy political influencers epitomized the fragility of Russia’s
    newly liberated media commons. This project, funded by a NEH Collaborative Research
    Grant, investigates the encounter of the mainstream with the fringe, of ideologues
    and idealists, of dazzling creativity and rank commercialism in post-Soviet Russophone
    print, television, Web 1.0, and radio media. By preserving, interrogating, and
    (re-)interpreting key artifacts from the “long 1990s,” which began with Mikhail
    Gorbachev’s glasnost’ in 1986 and ended with the election of Vladimir Putin in
    2000, our curated collection sheds light on a remarkable, if short-lived, period
    in recent Russian history.

  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: By the late twentieth century, conservation scientists declared that time
    was “running out” for Madagascar as plant species were “disappearing 500 times
    faster than normal.” Plants deemed immortal in Malagasy culture, such as the famous
    Baobab Tree have, for the past few decades, teetered on the edge of extinction.
    Yet the contingencies of climate change have shifted conservation priorities so
    dramatically that, in recent years, botanical evolutionary concepts have been
    applied unequally in light of seemingly more pressing human-centric concerns.
    Without plants, though, humans will go extinct. Focusing on the nineteenth and
    twentieth century plant collections at the Missouri Botanical Garden and New York
    Botanical Garden, this project will (1) create a database of herbarium specimens
    collected in Madagascar, (2) use ArcGis to map the locations of these specimens,
    and (3) map plantations of luxury high-priced botanicals that have driven human-centric
    agriculture (vanilla, clove, and coffee). By incorporating Malagasy worldviews
    about the place of plants in their broader environment into this digital project,
    I question how ecological and evolutionary knowledge has been created and conveyed
    to both local and global conservation groups on an island rife with deforestation,
    political and social conflict—all contributing to its status as one of the top
    ten nations most vulnerable to climate change. Intersecting conservation law,
    critical archival studies, and the history of science, this project uses a variety
    of scientific specimens and data alongside archival material to question the colonial
    legacies of conservation science over Malagasy knowledge.

  abstract: Following the framework of distant reading, this project aims to provide
    a comprehensive analysis of gendered social relationships in American literature
    (1880-2000). While multiple studies in the distant reading paradigm have investigated
    conceptual associations of male and female characters in American fiction, this
    project is, to the best of my knowledge, the first to focus explicitly on how
    gendered characters interact, that is, the concrete narrative actions exchanged
    between characters of different genders. To do this, the project builds on software
    developed by the author that allows for the automatic extraction of semantic motifs
    associated with entities in textual data. Substantively, the project focuses on
    two main research questions. First, it aims to clarify whether relationships have
    become more symmetric over the 20th century in terms of their action content,
    and if so, whether this trend has been a linear one. Second, it aims to conduct
    a fine-grained analysis into the evolution of the semantics of gendered relationships
    by identifying and tracing distinct relationship frames such as friendship, courtship
    and love, or parenting.

    in the U.S.” Working with PDFs of the AJYB, fully and freely accessible online,
    my proposed summer project will transform the AJYB’s raw text into structured
    data. The project’s first output will include a new dataset of Jewish population
    across the U.S. and Canada for each decade across the 20th century, and a census-oriented
    map of this population. I have already transcribed population counts for the years
    1950, 1960, 1971, 1980, and 1990, creating 3,373 rows of data.  Tasks for this
    component involve transcription, data “cleaning,” and matching Jewish population
    entries with geographic coordinates and with general U.S. population counts for
    the same geographic areas and decades. The project''s second output will be open-ended
    textual analysis, based on digitally parsing approximately 30,550 AJYB pages from
    1948 to 1995, focusing on Jewish Orthodox organizations, personalities, and events.
    The AJYB’s publisher is not aware of any comparable mapping, data visualization

  abstract: |-
    British polar exploration in the nineteenth century was a close-knit community, held together by professional endeavor and personal connection. Lasting from 1818 to 1859, this era was characterized by its close association with the Admiralty and the government, the beginnings of the use of steam power and industrial technology in exploration, and the introduction of the concepts of the British-conquered Arctic and Antarctic into the popular imagination, laying the foundation for decades of imperial myth-making and exploratory endeavor to come. 
    Legendary figures such as Sir John Franklin still dominate discussions of this era, but polar exploration was a national pastime, broadly involving people of all classes in its planning, participation, and popular reception, from artists to lords to politicians to outspoken critics. Performing social network analysis on information collected via archival research, I plan to produce a set of interactive data visualizations cataloging the historical participants in Victorian polar exploration, illuminating unexpected correlations, and allowing for easy viewing of the myriad nodes and edges of the wider community. 
    This public humanities project will draw on my scholarly interests in communities of affinity and participatory cultures in order to encourage continued interest in the lesser-studied aspects of polar history. Presenting this information digitally in accessible visual form will, I hope, prompt new inquiries into the lesser-known relationships and figures who make up the underlying layers of the Victorian polar milieu.

    mysticism. In fact, only 153 of the 10,393 entries in OpenITI are Sufi works,
    despite Sufism’s immense popularity over the last millennium. Given this gap in
    the extant textual corpora, this project will produce the first machine actionable
    corpus of medieval Sufi works, comprised of twenty-four key texts annotated according
    to the field standard mARkdown “tagging” schema. Furthermore, this project will

    to better understand Sufi social history; examining Qur’ānic references to illuminate
    how Sufis interpreted and understood the word of God; using algorithms to elucidate
    the complex and subtle ways in which authors drew from one another; and exploring
    the changing semantics of key terms and foundational concepts in Sufi thought
    across time. This project will not only shed new light on medieval Sufi history

    The aim is to engender and amplify scholarly exchange around changing digital
    practices and methods for humanistic research on, in, and of the larger Middle
    East. Our application is for the development and creation of the initial infrastructure
    of S/S/C. In the first year, six solicited pieces will serve as methods and practice-based
    chronicles detailing multi-modal and multi-media approaches to digital scholarship
    on, in, and of the region from a diverse set of academics. During the initial
    year we will build the S/S/C hub and plan its future expansion, establish an advisory
    board, host a roundtable at the 2022 Middle East Studies Association conference,
    establish a long-term partnership with the Kevorkian Center and its fledgling
    Digital Middle East Lab, and seek other potential partners and funding.

  abstract: The vast majority of non-European alchemy sources remains, for a variety
    of reasons, untranslated. I address the strategic question of where to start the
    slow, labor intensive process of translating vast multilingual corpora from the
    Middle East, India and China. My short-term focus is to use natural language processing
    (NLP) methods of unsupervised metaphor detection to triage untranslated alchemical
    texts and sort them for different research needs. I propose to identify key metaphoric
    phrases drawn from well-known English alchemical text as a basis for our NLP discrimination
    model. Recent advances in unsupervised metaphor detection, based on the ubiquity
    of metaphor in all languages may anchor NLP detection of naturally occuring meaningful
    clusters in virtually any language. My overarching goal is to demonstrate the
    potential of digital humanities tools in combination with computational chemistry
    resources, such as the Reaxys CC database, with data on 200 million chemical substances
    and about 60 million chemical reactions from 1750 to 2015. My colleague, Prof.
    Restrepo at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Science, and the History
    of Science, has licensed access through MPI to Reaxys and has agreed to collaborate
    on extending his analysis of chemical knowledge production to pre-1750 periods.

  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: 'This project is a catalyst for access to open Villa La Pietra’s rich
    collection of over 6000 objects dating from the 17th to 20th centuries for audiences
    with disabilities. Working at the intersection of Museum Studies and Computer
    Science, Historic Fractures: Toward A Digital Future in Museum Accessibility leverages
    inclusive design practices and digital technology to make historic house museums
    accessible. Faculty members from Museum Studies and Computer Science conduct original
    field research at Villa La Pietra with students to lead content and development
    for the creation of three digital modules designed for a range of visitors with
    disabilities: 1) an augmented reality platform that integrates historical and
    archival photography to create a guided tour for visitors that are deaf or have
    low levels of hearing 2) a relational database of signatures that trace connected
    histories of early 20th c. visitors 3) implementation of a selected museum object
    from Villa La Pietra’s collection for visitors that are blind or have low vision.
    By training the next generation of computer scientists and museum scholars as
    highly-informed advocates for audiences with diverse motor, cognitive, sensory,
    and behavior-emotional disabilities, this project supports tactical and strategic
    skills to develop multi-sensory content in historic houses.'

  title: Mapping the Circulation of Mizrahi Texts in the Arab World, 1948-1982
  category: Grad Fellowship Project
  tags:
  - spatial-humanities
  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: 'Looking at a number of publications from research institutes and publishing
    houses in the Arab world from 1948 to 1982, this project hopes to map the circulation
    of Mizrahi texts in the Arab world. In order to attend to the roles of different
    actors in the publication process, the project will detail how these works’ physical
    circulation, material dimensions, and intertextual relationships were integral
    to these texts’ reception. The project will use digital platforms such as Omeka
    in order to map, catalog, selectively digitize (in accordance with fair use guidelines),
    contextualize, and crucially, relate works published in English, French, Hebrew,
    and Arabic on Mizrahi thought. In the process, it hopes to ask: why and how have
    Arab intellectuals written about the Mizrahi struggle in Israel? Despite their
    purported focus on “the enemy,” many of these works translate and endorse the
    views of Mizrahi social movements; emphasize historic ties of Jewish communities
    with their co-citizens of other faiths in the Arab world; and elevate non-Zionist
    Jewish voices on the Palestinian Question. Indeed, all of the works in question
    argue that the stakes and impact of Mizrahi struggle are relevant, either as a
    part of or an obstacle to, the Palestinian struggle against Zionism. Rather than
    seeing Mizrahim and Palestinians as separate populations brought together only
    through their common position as oppressed, this study hopes to center these actors
    themselves showing how they engaged–even after their separation by partition and
    the hardening of borders–with each other and with broader global and regional
    intellectual currents such as Continental existentialism, Communism, Arab leftism,
    and Third Worldist thought.'

  title: Mapping, Visualizing and Analyzing the Sufi Mobility in the Early Modern
    Ottoman Empire
  category: Grad Fellowship Project
  tags:
  - spatial-humanities
  cohort_year: '2022'
  abstract: 'My proposed project aims to visualize the mobility of the prominent Sufi
    figures in the early modern Ottoman Empire by generating maps with the help of
    digital tools like GIS. This project is threefold: the first aim is to create
    a data set involving prominent Sufi figures in the Ottoman Empire between the
    sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Investigating both primary and secondary sources,
    such as travelogues, hagiographies, dissertations, and articles; I plan to create
    a comprehensive data set to determine the itinerancies of the Sufi figures by
    generating metadata (name, date of death, affiliated Sufi order, traveled cities,
    the purpose for travel, duration of stay). The second step is the visualization
    of the data set by creating numerous sequential maps via GIS that will indicate
    the itinerancies of these Sufi figures. The last step is to analyze these maps
    to illuminate the urban aspect of Sufism as well as the religious functions of
    urban centers. A thorough visualization of the Sufi itinerancies with this project
    can yield interesting results and raise questions to delve more into the social,
    intellectual, and power dynamics of this era. However, to be able to raise these
    questions, I will start with the first step: the urban centers where all these
    interactions were happening. Thus, this project will serve as a basis for further
    research on the Sufis and their relationship to the urban fabric and thus, the
    religious and urban history of the Ottoman Empire.'
